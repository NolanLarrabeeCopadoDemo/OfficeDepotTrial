                specific audiences. A digital welcome packet will contain a variety of communications to make sure that 
                the right stakeholders are preinformed about what they’ll experience. For example, Receiving may need to
                be notified of a different delivery driver, and Finance/ Accounts Payable will receive information regarding
                a modified invoice that now includes the Office Depot logo. This is important information to ensure a smooth
                transition. (See examples below.)</span>
