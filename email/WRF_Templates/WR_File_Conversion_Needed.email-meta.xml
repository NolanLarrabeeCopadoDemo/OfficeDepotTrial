Thank you for your Work Request submission for {!Case.Account}.  Your request does not contain some information in a usable format.


In order for us to price a bid or work request, you will need to provide an item list file in an Excel format that contains a column with one of the following:


· OD SKU#

· Manufacturer Number

· Major competitor item numbers


We have sent your request to Regional Sales Support to have the file converted.  Once that has been completed, we will task the relevant pricing team.


Please note that this delays the tasking process and may prevent the relevant support teams with sufficient time to complete your request in a timely manner.


Thank you,


BSD BIDS</textOnly>
