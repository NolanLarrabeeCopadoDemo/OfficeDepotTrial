Thank you for your Work Request submission for {!Case.Account}.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with you.

In order for us to price a bid or work request, you will need to provide an item list file in an Excel format that contains a column with one of the following:


· OD,

· Manufacturer, or

· Major competitor item numbers (at a minimum).


If the item list you have is not in an Excel format, please submit a Field Work Request to HCL using the following link:


http://sp.na.odcorp.net/sites/BSG/FWR/default.aspx


Select the Excel Bid List Request Type and attach the file and template for HCL to key the item #&apos;s into.  If you only have hard copies, they can be faxed to HCL at 408-962-1117.


Once you have received the Excel file, please reply to this email with your attachment.


Thank you,


BSD BIDS</textOnly>
