    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},



I just got word that I am in a position to be more aggressive than usual on HP Printer pricing this month. HP dropped our cost so they can hit a goal for April and I can pass the savings on to you! Were you planning to get any printers that you could order in April to take advantage of this?



If so, let me know the model and quantities and I will see what kind of deal they are willing to make. They are looking for bulk orders but I&apos;ll see what I can do for any request.


If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call me.  I am here to assist you with anything you may need and I look forward to speaking with you.



Warm Regards,
