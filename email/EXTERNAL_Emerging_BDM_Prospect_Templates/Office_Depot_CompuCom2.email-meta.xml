Did you hear that Office Depot acquired CompuCom? Do you know what this can potentially mean for your business? This truly is a monumental move that brings all of the Tech products and services you need under one roof.

Please review the attached brochure for the details. I&apos;ll follow up in a few days to get your thoughts and to see when we can introduce our Technology Team.
