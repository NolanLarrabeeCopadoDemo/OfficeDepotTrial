Subject: Appropriate Person

I am writing in hopes of finding the appropriate person who handles (office supplies, adjacencies). I also reached out to person X, person Y and person Z in that pursuit. If it makes sense to talk, let me know how your calendar looks.

Office Depot is more than office supplies. We are one of the largest online B2B companies in the world and specialize in driving value to companies like (X,Y,Z). We have a world class distribution network as well as retail locations nationally where you can receive the best of either your contract or retail price while in the store. We are also a national distributor of janitorial &amp; breakroom supplies, tech, print, furniture and promotional products. You can count on an intuitive website and a suite of reporting to help manage your business.

Typical savings on goods &amp; services could be up to 20% by allowing us to evaluate your current program. At the very least meeting and sharing information will validate you have a good program or reduce your cost.

If you are the appropriate person to speak to, what does your calendar look like? If not, who do you recommend I talk to?
