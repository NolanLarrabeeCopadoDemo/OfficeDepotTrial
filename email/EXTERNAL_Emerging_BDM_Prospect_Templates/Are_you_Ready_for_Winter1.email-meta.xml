    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


I want to make sure your office is as healthy and safe as possible. Winter will be here soon. Are you ready?


Are your employees protected against the flu and other viruses to cut down on sick calls? You can buy Facial Tissue, Purell Hand Care, and First Aid kits at Office Depot to keep everyone healthy.


Are your floors protected from the sand and snow? I can help you with Matting, Dust traps, brooms, mops, and vacuums to keep your floors clean and protected.


Is your facility ready deal with storms? Office Depot has Ice melt, shovels, gloves, flashlights, and batteries to get you through the storm.


Do you have all the best beverage flavors and snacks in your breakroom to keep people warm and productive? People love our healthy food options and specialty beverages like Pumpkin spice, Apple Cider, and Teaja Organic Loose Leaf Tea.</textOnly>
