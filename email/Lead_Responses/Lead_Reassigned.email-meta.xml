Dear {!Receiving_User.Name},

One or more leads have been reassigned due to lack of activity within the first 3 business days of the customer&apos;s inquiry. If you contacted the customer previously, the activity was not logged in Salesforce. If you feel this is an error, please contact salesforce@officedepot.com.

Thank you,
Sales Operations Team
