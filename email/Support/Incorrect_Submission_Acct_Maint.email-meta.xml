This request was submitted incorrectly and cannot be processed.  This type of request should have been submitted as an Account Maintenance Request.  Please submit a new request using the Account Maintenance button on the Account page or the Account Maintenance Request link in Quick Links.

If this is an emergency and needs immediate attention because the customer cannot order, you can submit an email to ContractMaint@officedepot.com.  **However, upon review, ContractMaint may still require you to submit through the Salesforce.com Account Maintenance process.

For further information about Account Maintenance requests you can search Account Maintenance in the Answers tab of Salesforce.com.

Thank you,
Salesforce Support Team</textOnly>
