    <textOnly>Dear Cleaning/Breakroom Support Team:

Please be advised this OD North Customer is in the process of being migrated to OD South and the OD North account will be closed.

We have determined that the Customer has purchased CBS products in the past.  Please contact the Sales Representative who manages this account.   This is an excellent opportunity to increase the spend in the Cleaning/Breakroom adjacency.

Link to Customer: {!Customer_Transition__c.Link}

Thank you for your support.
