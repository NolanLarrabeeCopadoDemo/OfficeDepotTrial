    <textOnly>Hello, 
I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Scott Pearson and I am your Inside Account Manager. I work in partnership with your Inside Sales Representative. Moving forward, I will be the point of contact for you. I&apos;ll be able to help you get the most out of your Office Depot Business Account and guide you through any difficulties you may find along the way. I try to reach out monthly, however if there is anything that you need in the interim, please reach out to me any time. 

Thanks again, and have a great day!
