    <textOnly>{!Today}

Dear  {!Contact.Name}:

I am very excited to tell you that the Fifth Annual Office Depot Foundation Charity Invitational is taking place on Thursday, February 6, 2014, at the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club in beautiful Boca Raton, Florida. This exceptional event includes golf, deep sea fishing, bass fishing, a spa experience, a gourmet culinary experience and − new this year – in-shore fishing on Biscayne Bay and TWO exhilarating opportunities to go racing at Homestead-Miami Speedway and Palm Beach International Raceway. It all begins on the evening of Wednesday, February 5, with the extraordinary “Night of Opportunities” dinner at the Boca Resort’s magnificent Mizner Center.

The Invitational raises vitally important funds for the Office Depot Foundation – the independent, non-profit charitable giving arm of Office Depot. The Foundation’s key priorities include giving children tools to succeed in school and in life, building the capacity of nonprofit organizations and helping communities recover and rebuild after disasters.

I invite you to review the Office Depot Foundation Invitational Sponsorship Opportunities Registration Website right away at www.officedepotfoundation.org/invitational to learn about the many ways you can support this exceptionally worthy cause and have an extraordinary day of camaraderie, excitement and fun with members of the Office Depot Operating Committee, the Merchandising group and other key Company associates. You can register to participate and pay right on the site.

The registration deadline is January 10, 2014. Many of these exciting activities were completely sold out for the 2013 Invitational, so I urge you to make a decision as soon as possible.

Thank you for your consideration and support. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.


Best regards,
