    <subject>TAX EXEMPTION 1 WEEK NOTIFICATION - {!Account.Cust_ID__c} - {!Account_Profile__c.Address_State__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.OwnerFullName} and {!Account.Account_Owner_Manager_Name__c},


This is the 3rd and final notice to advise you that your customer, {!Account.Name}, Account # {!Account.Cust_ID__c}, for the state of {!Account_Profile__c.Address_State__c} is tax exempt. This certificate will expire in one week.



Therefore, it is critical that you obtain a new tax exemption certificate from your customer and provide it to the Tax Department immediately. Failure to provide an updated certificate will result in your customer being viewed as a taxable entity until a new tax certificate is submitted. Fax or email the certificate to the tax department: BSD-TaxExemption@officedepot.com


Fax # 561-438-2406


Questions? Call 800-848-8100


Thank you for your assistance in this matter.


Sincerely,


Office Depot Tax Department</textOnly>
