    <subject>WRF Task {!WRF_Task__c.Name} Pricing Completion – DOA Reminder</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,



The {!WRF_Task__c.Name} has been marked completed. This sub task type indicates that pricing has been created and/or changed. Per our companies Delegation of Authority guidelines a CPM may need to be launched. CPMs are to be launched prior to customer submittal on all customers who:



- Are under (or will result in) a written agreement
- Contain rebates (outside of existing GPO approved structures)
- Are priced under an existing GPO but pricing/incentives created deviate from the GPO’s approved structure.



If your pricing meets any of this criteria, please be sure to launch a CPM through SalesForce to the necessary DOA approvers. If there is no need to obtain DOA approval, please confirm that the Main Task, {!WRF_Task__c.Parent_WRF_Task__c}&apos;s stage reflects “Pending Award.”

Thank You!</textOnly>
