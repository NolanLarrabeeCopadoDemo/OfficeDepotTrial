    <textOnly>Dear #Customer_Name#,
I want to let you know I left you a voicemail message to introduce myself as your new Office Depot® Account Manager. I’m sorry I missed you, but I look forward to catching up with you soon.
I’m here to help you save time, maximize savings and increase your ordering efficiency, so don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have.
In the meantime, I want to offer this exclusive coupon (below) to help you SAVE on your next purchase. It’s just a small token to say thanks for your business.
Again, I look forward to touching base with you soon. You can reach me during normal business hours at: #Rep_Phone# or #Rep_Email#
Sincerely,
