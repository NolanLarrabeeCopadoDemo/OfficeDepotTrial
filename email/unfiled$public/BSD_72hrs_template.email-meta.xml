Dear {!Lead.Previous_User__c},


Your lead from {!Lead.Name} has been reassigned due to lack of activity within the first 72 hours of the customers&apos; inquiry. If you contacted the customer previously, the activity was not logged in Salesforce. If you feel this is an error, please contact salesforce@officedepot.com.

Thank you,

Sales Operations Team
