Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}:<br />
<br />
This is Charles&nbsp;from our Business Services team with Office Depot. I saw that you recently expressed an interest in our services, &nbsp;so I wanted to reach out and introduce myself as your main point of contact.<br />
<br />

<ul>
	<li>Increasing overall online presence with Web Design, Logo Design, Social Media, Search Engine&nbsp;Optimization &amp; Pay Per Click</li>
	<li>Buttoning up your bookkeeping &amp; making financial reporting simpler with our Accounting Services</li>
	<li>Managing employees and remaining compliant with our Payroll &amp; HR Services.</li>
	<li>Incorporate your business with our Legal Services.</li>
</ul>

I would love to schedule some time over the next week to better understand your business as well as demonstrate how our suite of solutions could fit your needs.<br />
<br />
Please let me know when would be the best to schedule some time to review.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, don&rsquo;t hesitate to call me directly - my contact info is below! Look forward to hearing back,</span><br />
