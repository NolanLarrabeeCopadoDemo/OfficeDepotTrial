    <textOnly>Good day,
I want to take a minute to let you about a new and exciting program from Office Depot.

Your business can take advantage of the combined buying power of this multi-million dollar office supply program, which provides aggressive discounts on the supplies you use everyday. And there are no participation fees or contractual spend obligations.

Platinum Purchasing program benefits include:
Best value core list with up to 80% off 300 frequently ordered items
Custom best value core list available
Store Purchasing Card available so you can receive your program pricing in store
Copy &amp; Print Services discounts include B&amp;W at .025 cents, Color at .22 cents and 35% off finishing services
