Dear {!Lead.OwnerFullName},


Your lead for {!Lead.Name} has been waiting for you in Salesforce for the last 48 hours. At Office Depot, we want to be sure that our customer inquiries to sales are follow-up on in a timely manner. Please go into Salesforce and disposition the below lead within the next 24 hours.  Failure to log activity in Salesforce against the lead within the next 24 hours will result in it being reassigned.


Link to your lead: {!Lead.Link}


FAQs:

Q: I have called the customer previously, why do I need to log that in Salesforce?

A: There are many reasons for leads from existing accounts to come into Salesforce. Regardless of the reason, we want to ensure these customers are getting contacted (email or phone).  The only way to track the follow-up effectively is through Salesforce.


Q: Is it hard to track follow-up in Salesforce?

A: No, it is very easy.  Click on the link in this email and change the lead status to &quot;Contacted&quot; or by adding a new note to the &quot;Notes&quot; section.


Thank you,

Sales Operations Team</textOnly>
