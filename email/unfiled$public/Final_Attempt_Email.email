<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="background:white;">Hello from Business Services with Office Depot,</span><br /> <br /> <span style="background:white;">I made a note to contact you this week and see where you are in your decision to discuss specific services we offer based on your initial interest.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="background:white;">1. Are you ready to schedule a call?</span><br /> <span style="background:white;">2. Did you decide to go with another vendor or not make a change?</span><br /> <span style="background:white;">3. Do you need more time?</span><br /> <br /> <span style="background:white;">Let me know and I will follow your lead.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="background:white;">Thanks,</span><br /> &nbsp;</span>
