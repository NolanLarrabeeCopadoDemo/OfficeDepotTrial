    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer:



There are exciting things going on at OfficeDepot®, Inc. I’m reaching out personally to share a few important details with you. As a valued OfficeMax®customer, I’d like to convey some key information to prepare you and {!Customer_Transition__c.Account__c} for a coordinated transition to the Office Depot System. The most important thing to know is that our team is standing by with the process, tools and resources to facilitate a simple, seamless transition.



The entire Office Depot team is committed to a flawless implementation and execution on your behalf. We’ve got the tools and the know-how to build a customized plan linking the time and resources that are best for you.



A dedicated program manager has been assigned to your business, and our implementation team will ensure that you have the best customer experience possible — one where you can be involved as much or as little as you’d like.



To get things started, I’d like to set up a meeting with you within the next week to discuss our approach and recommended timing as well as to answer any questions that you may have. I will contact you to arrange a meeting at a convenient time.



Remember, throughout this transition, Office Depot is focused on YOU, our Customer. We appreciate your business and know that we’re better equipped than ever to be your trusted partner.



Regards,



Signature
