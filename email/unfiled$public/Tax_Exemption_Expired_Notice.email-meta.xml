    <subject>TAX EXEMPTION EXPIRED NOTIFICATION - {!Account.Cust_ID__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.OwnerFullName} and {!Account.Account_Owner_Manager_Name__c} and {!Account_Profile__c.Account_Owner_Manager_lvl_3__c},


This is the 3rd and final notice is to advise you that your customer, {!Account.Name}, Account # {!Account.Cust_ID__c} was tax exempt. This certificate will expire tomorrow. The customer will now be charged tax tomorrow.



Therefore, it is critical that you obtain a new tax exemption certificate from your customer and provide it to the Tax Department immediately. Failure to provide an updated certificate will result in your customer being viewed as a taxable entity until a new tax certificate is submitted.

Fax or email the certificate to the tax department: BSD-TaxExemption@officedepot.com


Fax # 561-438-2406


Questions? Call 800-848-8100


Thank you for your assistance in this matter.


Sincerely,


Office Depot Tax Department</textOnly>
