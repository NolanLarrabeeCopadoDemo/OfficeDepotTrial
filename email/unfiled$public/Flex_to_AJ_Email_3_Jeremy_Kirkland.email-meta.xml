    <textOnly>Good day,

Thank you for taking the time today to talk. I am glad we could connect.

While the Platinum Purchasing program may not be the right fit for you at this time, Office Depot is always here as a resource for all your business needs. Should you decide to consider this program again, please feel free to contact me. 

I will follow up with you at a later date to see if your office supply needs have changed.

Thank you.
