    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Support_Requester__c},

You have been granted Contributor access to our content management tool Seismic, which can be found at https://officedepot.seismic.com. Upon initial login, you may be prompted for a one-time email validation and will then proceed to the site.

This tool has been designed with our Sales associates in mind, so that content is easily discoverable, relevant and provides resources to quickly sell and close deals.

With your enhanced access comes the responsibility to observe and adhere to specific rules and practices that have been established by the Seismic Governance Committee. These rules and practices are addressed in the comprehensive How-to Videos and How-to Guides provided by the Training Team. These resources may be found by searching and navigating to the SEISMIC CONTENT CONTRIBUTORS MAIN PAGE.

There is no need to reply to this email and you may proceed with accessing Seismic, as described above. 

For all questions, issues or feedback, please feel free to send an email to seismic@officedepot.com.

Best Regards,
Seismic Support Team
