    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.FirstName},



I would like to invite you to our upcoming free web seminar on Tuesday, October 17 at 2:00 ET, entitled Makerspaces, Drones and Robotics: The Next Generation of STEM Learning.



This seminar will feature superintendents from Roscoe Collegiate ISD in Texas and the Wallingford Public Schools in Connecticut, two districts that have attracted national attention for their innovative STEM programs, which incorporate new tools and technologies such as drones, robotics and makerspaces.



We also welcome grant funding expert Paula Love, president of RFPMatch.com, who will share specific, actionable funding resources from both public and private sources that can help to support your school or district STEM initiatives.



We&apos;re looking forward to a very informative presentation and discussion, plus live Q&amp;A.  Even if you aren&apos;t able to attend the live event, feel free to register and you will receive access to the presentation and the event recording. Hope to see you there!</textOnly>
