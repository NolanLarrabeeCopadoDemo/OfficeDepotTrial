    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you so much for your time today.


As we discussed, Office Depot has been working with our partners at Google to bring to market a resource, a comprehensive kit, that empowers educators to guide their learners on virtual field trips to anywhere in the world and beyondâ€¦.



We have curated an affordable, easy to use, VR class set that will immediately allow educators to authentically extend learning beyond the classroom with diverse high quality Google Expeditions.



With over 500 pre-loaded Google field trips from tours of solar systems to micro tours of blood systems!  These class sets include everything needed to provide educators guided tours of wonders, attractions, and systems in our world and beyond! This as innovative way to connect learning to the worlds beyond the classroom!


I have linked a list of the current available fieldtrips. I know that these fieldtrips would not only innovate learning in your school, but also excite and inspire your learners.


I have attached an overview of our solution which you can order through your business account.


Please click GOOGLE EXPEDITION to see what we have brought to you.

Please click VIDEO to see the actual footage of google expeditions
