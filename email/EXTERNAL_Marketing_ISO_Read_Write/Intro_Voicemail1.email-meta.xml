    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I called today for an introduction but you were unavailable at the time.


Our team oversee&apos;s your purchasing account with Office Depot.


I am a direct contact for you here if you ever need assistance with a recommendation or to address any concerns you may have regarding purchasing.


As a courtesy, I attached our &quot;Ready to Ship&quot; supply list to this message for additional ease of ordering supplies that deliver next business day from our Facilities and Break-room Solutions Catalog.



If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call me. I am here to assist you with anything you may need and I look forward to working with you.


Best Regards,</textOnly>
