    <textOnly>Good Afternoon {!Contact.FirstName},

We are happy to announce enhancements to your Office Depot Program with Avendra.  These enhancements will allow your purchasing processes to be further streamlined.

It is important that we take some time to learn about your purchasing needs to ensure a seamless transition for you.
