    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I really enjoyed our phone conversation earlier today and especially liked learning about your personalized learning needs at (district name) and interest in the IBM Watson Classroom solution.  I understand the challenges you are facing and the impact this solution can have on assisting you in meeting your goals.

As promised, I am introducing you to Bryan Bown on this email.  Bryan is our Instructional Lead Consultant for Watson Classroom.  Bryan is a former educator himself and will be reaching out to you to set up a meeting to visit your district and demonstrate the solution while discussing your districtsâ€™ AI Readiness needs.

I have also included this link: https://www.odc2l.com/ibm-watson-education/ providing you with some resources and materials that can help you better understand the solution and how it can help you.

Please let me know if you have any questions on Watson Classroom or any of our other holistic solutions.  Otherwise, I look forward to talking with you again and wish you a good day.


Thank you
