Effective April 17, 2017, your Office Depot pricing program with NIPA (National Intergovernmental Pricing Alliance) no longer supports the purchasing of items outside of the contracted assortment. This is due to a change in NIPA (National Intergovernmental Purchasing Alliance) contract which is outside of our control. It is not mandatory that you move to another pricing program, however, as your Account Manager, I want you to have unrestricted access to all Office Depot products.



Fortunately, our Region 4 (a sister organization of NIPA) pricing program for government, education and nonprofit entities will provide you with pricing similar to what you&apos;ve been getting plus unrestricted access to all items outside the contracted assortment.



Region 4, formerly TCPN, is a group purchasing organization that secures very aggressive pricing for public accounts with Office Depot and is utilized by over 20,000 public sector agencies in all 50 states, and is available to the full range of political subdivisions as well as not-for-profit agencies.



Transitioning to the Region 4 pricing agreement for you and your end users will be completely transparent. Your Office Depot account numbers, user names and contact information will remain the same. You will simply continue to have the ability to purchase both the contracted items, as well as items outside of the contract assortment.



Here&apos;s what you need to do to make the transition.



Copy and paste the following verbiage and send it to me in an e-mail:

“We qualify as a Public/Non-Profit Account. Please provide our account with Region 4 pricing.”



Also include your Federal Taxpayer ID Number (TIN). We&apos;ll be able to activate the pricing generally within 48 hours after your approval is completed.</textOnly>
