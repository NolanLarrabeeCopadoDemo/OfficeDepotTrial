    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am reaching out you in regards to your districts goals to support modern learning and educational innovation. We are now working with districts across the country to create innovative physical and virtual learning environments; spaces that engage digital natives and facilitate the learning of modern skills like Creativity, Critical Thinking, and Collaboration. From makerspaces to modern media centers we have the tools and the environmental resources to empower modern teaching and learning.

I have attached a glimpse of our portfolio. I would like to schedule time to go over this portfolio. During this time, I will provide an overview of national trends in modern learning and speak to how Office Depot can help actuate your district&apos;s vision (or school&apos;s vision) for a Modern Learning Utopia!

Thank you!
