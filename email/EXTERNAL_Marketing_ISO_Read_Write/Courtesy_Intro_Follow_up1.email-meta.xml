    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for the time today and welcoming my call...

As I mentioned, our team oversee&apos;s the Purchasing Account with Office Depot. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call me.  I am here to assist you with anything you may need and I look forward to working with you.


I attached our &quot;Ready to Ship&quot; supply list to this message for supplies that deliver next business day from our Facilities and Break-room Solutions Catalog and our Elle Decor Furniture overview. These are a great resource for many locations for saving time and cost for the Welcome Center and Maintenance Team.

That&apos;s all for today... Thanks again for the time and the continued business!!


Best Regards,

Paul Gomez
