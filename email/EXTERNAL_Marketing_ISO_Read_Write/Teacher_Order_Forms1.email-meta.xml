    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},



Please take a look at the attached order form with the updated TCPN pricing on our most popular school supplies.  I think you will find this to be a very handy tool to help your teachers and staff to get organized and save money.

We also offer a wide variety of solutions exclusively for education, from furniture to professional development and much more. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call me.  I am here to assist you with anything you may need and I look forward to speaking with you.









Warm Regards,
