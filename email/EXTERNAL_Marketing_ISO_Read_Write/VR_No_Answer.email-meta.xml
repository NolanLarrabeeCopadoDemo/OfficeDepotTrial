    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for your partnership with Office Depot!


In reviewing district’s goals, I noticed that there is much focus on extending and innovating learning beyond the classroom.


Office Depot has been working with our partners at Google to bring to market a resource, a comprehensive kit, that empowers educators to guide their learners on virtual fieldtrips to anywhere in the world and beyond….


I have linked a list of the current available fieldtrips. I know that these fieldtrips would not only innovate learning in your school, but also excite and inspire your learners.


I have attached an overview of our solution which you can order through your business account.


Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a time to discuss the solution?


Please click GOOGLE EXPEDITION to see what we have brought to you.

Please click VIDEO to see the actual footage of google expeditions
walk through.

To view the overall k-12 solutions Office Depot has invested in for you, please click Committed To Learning and be prepared to be amazed!

THANK YOU!
