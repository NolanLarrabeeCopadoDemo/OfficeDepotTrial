    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Office Depot is committed to helping keep your teachers and students happy and healthy this cold and flu season!

Did you know student illnesses cause $144 million in lost school days each year, impacting students&apos; ability to learn. Additionally, teacher absenteeism generates $4 billion in extra annual expenses.

We&apos;re here to help reduce the spread of cold and flu viruses in your schools. We are partnering with leading vendors like Clorox, Lysol, Kleenex, Purell and many more to help you stop the spread of cold and flu viruses in your school.

National studies show improved classroom hygiene can reduce classroom illness and absenteeism resulting in significant savings for your school, call or email me for more information on how we can help.
