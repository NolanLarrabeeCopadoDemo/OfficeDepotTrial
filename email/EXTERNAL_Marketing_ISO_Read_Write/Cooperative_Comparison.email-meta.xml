    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},



As you know, your Office Depot account utilizes the National IPA office supply pricing program with the State of Florida as the lead public agency.  The current National IPA/State of Florida program allows participants to purchase the contracted items, as well as items outside of the contract assortment. Effective April 17, 2017, the State of Florida&apos;s agreement with National IPA will no longer support the purchasing of items outside of the contracted assortment.  Instead, The City of Tamarac will also now take on the role as a lead public agency with National IPA - the pricing structure and discounts will be the same for each program, however, the City&apos;s agreement will allow for the purchasing of both the contracted and non-contracted items.


On April 17, 2017, unless you request otherwise, your Office Depot account will remain under the National IPA/State of Florida agreement.  If you do not wish to remain under the National IPA/State of Florida agreement, but instead would prefer to transition to the National IPA/City of Tamarac contract, your acknowledgment is required.  Should you decide to transition to the City&apos;s agreement, the change for you and your end users will be completely transparent. Your Office Depot account numbers, user names and contact information will remain the same. You will simply continue to have the ability to purchase both the contracted items, as well as items outside of the contract assortment.


To transition to the National IPA/City of Tamarac program, please reply to this email stating your preference to transition from the National IPA/State of Florida agreement to the National IPA/City of Tamarac&apos;s agreement. Please include your federal tax id number as well.
