    <textOnly>Customer, 
Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today!
As I explained during our conversation, my name is Juanita Deleon and I am excited to be your new dedicated Office Depot Program Manager. 
Here at Office Depot, it is our continuing goal to satisfy and support you to the very best of our ability.   As such, we have recently made some big changes within our organization that will better help us to meet your needs and strengthen our relationship with you!
My personal goal as your dedicated program manager is to become a trusted resource and advisor to you and your organization.  
Keep in mind, we can not only help you with all of your standard office supplies needs, but we can also help you with solutions: 
     Custom marketing and print solutions 
     Technology hardware and services (recent purchase of CompuCom)
     Janitorial solutions 
     Breakroom solutions 

I look forward to our next conversation where I hope to learn as much as I can about your organization to be of maximum value. 
If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call me.  Myself or my virtual team are here to assist in making sure your experience with Office Depot is world class.
Thank you for your business and partnership!
