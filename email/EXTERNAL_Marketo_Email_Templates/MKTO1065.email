How have you repurposed staff and equity from that sale? Where do you see the biggest impact for cost control?<br><br>Indirect spend is low hanging fruit for you to bring in immediate savings. Grand and Toy has partnered with other companies such as Serta Simmons helping them navigate through tough financial times to yield cost savings.&nbsp;<br><br>Are you available for a 10 minute phone call on July 10th at 10am? I'd like to discuss some opportunities and changes since you last went to market for your supplies in 2017. If this time does not work for you please suggest an alternate.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you Masoud, looking forward to speaking.</div></body></html>
