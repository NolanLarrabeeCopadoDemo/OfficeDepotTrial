<span>Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, <br /><br />In these uncertain times, I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy.<br /><br /> Due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, many Canadian cities and provinces are making or have made masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces and I know many businesses are struggling to adjust. If your business is one of them, I just wanted to reach out and let you know that Grand &amp; Toy currently has a large inventory of face masks to support your needs. Our masks have gone through rigorous testing to ensure high quality and compliance with Canadian health standards.<br /><br /> As a business, you’re under additional scrutiny to ensure masks or face coverings are being worn in your space – i.e. face coverings for all your employees and visitors is your responsibility. To help, we’ve discounted our masks and are offering 3 boxes for $99.99 for a limited time.<br /><br /> If you have any questions or would like to place an order, please feel free to reach out. <br /><br /> Best Regards, </span>
