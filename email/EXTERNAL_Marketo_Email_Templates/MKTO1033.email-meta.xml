    <textOnly>Hi Carrie,

It’s been a few weeks since we dropped in. At Grand &amp; Toy we know indirect spends can quickly become a challenge to control, let us help.I just spoke with Bryant this morning, and he will be taking a look at our website to see if there is anything of interest that he would like quoted. Purpose of my email today is to ask if you have a timeline to send the usage information we discussed?  For a better understanding of the (thousands) of items we offer (may give you some ideas) please see a link to our website below. https://www.grandandtoy.com/ &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/]]&gt;   Please let us know if you are still interested in pursuing a business partnership with us.      Best regards,    Liz Rust Business Development Manager, Central Canada                       200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
