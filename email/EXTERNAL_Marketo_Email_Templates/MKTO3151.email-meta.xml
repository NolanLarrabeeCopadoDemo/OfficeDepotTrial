    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 I’m reaching out to you again because I’ve been looking for ways to reduce your business costs now and in the future.

 After taking a deep dive into your account, I see that you could benefit from switching to a new plan that will help you achieve greater savings.

 You’ll be able to save up to 15% on solutions across all office essentials, including Paper and Cleaning &amp; Maintenance products. And if the savings guarantee isn’t met, you’ll receive a rebate for the difference! 

 If you&apos;re interested in the plan and want more information, let me know when you would be available to connect.
