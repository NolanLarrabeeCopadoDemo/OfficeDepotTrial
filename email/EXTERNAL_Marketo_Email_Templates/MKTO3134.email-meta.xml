    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 Nice to meet you. My name is Annice, and I’m a customer success manager at Grand &amp; Toy, and part of my role is to find ways to better serve you.

 I’ve been reviewing your account, and I think you may be a good candidate to update your account to a new plan. You can check it out here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Annice-The-Account-Plan-Designed-to-Help-You-Save.html]]&gt;.

 This free, no contract plan, would provide you with a wide assortment of products with better than market pricing, helping your business save up to 15% annually.

 Are you available for a quick chat to connect about the plan in more detail? 


Annice Fender
Sales Support Assistant
