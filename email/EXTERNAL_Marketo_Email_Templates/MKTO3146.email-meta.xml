    <subject>Get Better Savings with New Account Plans</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

It’s Jimmy from Grand &amp; Toy once again, your new account manager. I’m reaching out one last time because I don’t want you to miss out on the amazing opportunity to update your account plan.

 These new account plans would provide you with savings that are usually reserved for larger businesses. They have no annual fees and you’d receive either 10% or 15% off across all product lines depending on which plan you choose. You’d also have a choice of payment options and visibility of your spend, along with many other benefits. You can have a closer look here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Jimmy_Supporting_Your_Business_is_Our_Business.html]]&gt;.

 If you have any questions or don’t feel as though they satisfy your needs, please feel free to contact me so we can discuss a 
solution that’s right for you.

 Thanks, 


Jimmy Kyung
Inside Account Manager
