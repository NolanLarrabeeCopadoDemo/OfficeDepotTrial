    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I hope this email finds you well. I’m Nancy, Denise’s colleague. She’s away right now and didn’t want you to miss out on this important information. So, she asked me to reach out to you on her behalf to get in touch with your back to work committee. We understand that when you decide to return to the office, nothing is more important than the health of your employees. That’s why it will be essential to ensure the office is properly prepared.    

As a valued Grand &amp; Toy client, I want you to be 
aware that we have already seen a major rush on all our safety-related solutions. By understanding your back to work plan, I can provide you with the most up to date information on stock and availability of items you are looking to procure to keep your employees safe when they return to the office. Are you available sometime this week for a chat?    

If you&apos;re not the right person to discuss this with, please forward this email to the your back to work committee or let me know who to contact. 

 Thanks!</textOnly>
