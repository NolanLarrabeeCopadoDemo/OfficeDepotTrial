    <textOnly>Hi Jason,

I hope all is well. Thank you for your voicemail. I tried calling back twice but the automated attendant did not come on. I can certainly assist here. Since January we have had a paper price increase. I will see what I can do since you&apos;re purchasing a skid at a time. When will you need the paper? I will need a week or so to confirm. As for the custom stamps email me what you need and I can get a quote done for you. Thank you again and have a good afternoon.


Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
