    <textOnly>Hi Karen,

I hope all is well and thank you for your time on the phone with me. I appreciate it greatly. I can certainly work with you on your procurement needs. Outside of the paper please let me know what PPE equipment you use. Anything else that you need to source that I can provide a solution for would be appreciated. I will work on an overall solution for you. Thank you again and have a good day.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
