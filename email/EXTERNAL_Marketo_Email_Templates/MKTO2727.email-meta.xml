    <textOnly>Good Afternoon {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

It’s Nancy here, Denise’s colleague. Since she is still away, I want to connect with you again to continue the discussion with your back to work committee about how to keep your professional family safe when they return to the office. I wanted to let you know that safety-related supplies continue to sell fast. 

We do have solutions in place that will reduce your need for limited and high consumption cleaning products that reduce cross-contamination, such as the Seal Shield™ ElectroClave™ &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/SY6523698_Seal_Shield_ElectroClave_-_R3_-_UV_disinfector_cabinet.aspx?cmp=ISODENISESEALSHIELD20EN&amp;utm_source=Marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Your+phone+has+20x+more+bacteria+than+a+toilet+seat&amp;utm_campaign=04+28+2020+-+BS+-+UV+Unit+Antimicrobial+Large+Enterprise&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRKa1pqRTVOR0ZoT1RnMiIsInQiOiI5Rjcrc0hSWmdVMG5YMGxHanlGeGduTHc3T0J6aHVqMFBXQ3JQQUtEZHIyNUFuT2RacDF2c1dURW5uVGVEOEp4VWpkQWEyMk1IUkFHcVh1TjZBT2lONFwvSmc4VXlpZDlQUkRqWStsTXVsaHlveFdyXC84dzBsbmlkS0tkS1hDTlZhIn0%3D]]&gt;. Cross-contamination of devices in the office could be an area of concern. Devices such as shared tablets, meeting room electronics and even personal smartphones could pose a risk to your employees. The ElectroClave™ &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/SY6523698_Seal_Shield_ElectroClave_-_R3_-_UV_disinfector_cabinet.aspx?cmp=ISODENISESEALSHIELD20EN&amp;utm_source=Marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Your+phone+has+20x+more+bacteria+than+a+toilet+seat&amp;utm_campaign=04+28+2020+-+BS+-+UV+Unit+Antimicrobial+Large+Enterprise&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRKa1pqRTVOR0ZoT1RnMiIsInQiOiI5Rjcrc0hSWmdVMG5YMGxHanlGeGduTHc3T0J6aHVqMFBXQ3JQQUtEZHIyNUFuT2RacDF2c1dURW5uVGVEOEp4VWpkQWEyMk1IUkFHcVh1TjZBT2lONFwvSmc4VXlpZDlQUkRqWStsTXVsaHlveFdyXC84dzBsbmlkS0tkS1hDTlZhIn0%3D]]&gt; provides an all-in-one solution using UV-C technology, managing the disinfection process of each of your devices and sends a notification when any are due for 
disinfection. 
Just like this unique solution, I do have others available that you may not have considered. Are you available for a quick chat to discuss? If you&apos;re not part of your back to work committee, please connect me with people who are or forward this email to them.

 Thanks!</textOnly>
