    <textOnly>Hi Tracy,

I hope all is well and thank you so much for your time on the phone with me. Thank you for confirming that everything is being delivered to one spot within the office. I have conveyed that the building itself is a stair carry and therefore your location on the second floor is the main point of delivery. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support you as well as ensure that everything goes smoothly. Thank you again and have a good day.



Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
