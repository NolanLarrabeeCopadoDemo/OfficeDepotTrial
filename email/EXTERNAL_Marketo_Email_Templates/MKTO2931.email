<span>Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, <br /><br /> In these uncertain times, I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. <br /><br /> As you may be aware, due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, many Canadian cities and provinces are making or have made masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces and I know many organizations are struggling to adjust. If your department is one of them, I just wanted to reach out and let you know that Grand &amp; Toy currently has a large inventory of face masks to support your needs. Our masks have gone through rigorous testing to ensure high quality and compliance with Canadian health standards. <br /><br /> As a government department, you’re under additional scrutiny because you need to lead by example. Along with providing staff with the appropriate face coverings, it’s also your responsibility to ensure all visitors are protected. To help, we're offering our Federal Government customers significant price savings on PPE and specifically face mask products. <br /><br /> If you have any questions or would like to place an order, please feel free to reach out. <br /><br /> Best Regards, </span>
