    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
 
Many organizations see ergonomics as a luxury or an afterthought but ergonomics is relevant to anyone who works. From improved working conditions to enhanced productivity, it’s the key to better satisfaction, performance, comfort, health and safety. 

 The Service Canada Guide to Office Ergonomics discusses: 
 	- Ergonomic job and workspace planning. 	- Products that improve employee comfort. 	- Desk stretches to reduce aches and pains. 	- And a free checklist for your workspace assessment.
