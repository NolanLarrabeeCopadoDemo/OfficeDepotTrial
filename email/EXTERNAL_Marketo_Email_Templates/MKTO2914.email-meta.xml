    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 My name is Victor. Yesterday I reached out to you regarding masks, so I wanted to take the chance to officially introduce myself. I&apos;m new to the Grand &amp; Toy team and I&apos;ve been assigned to support your company&apos;s account.




 I’ve been spending some time learning more about your company and I’m excited to support you on the 
necessary solutions that your business needs to stay safe and productive.

 I’d love to meet over the phone to connect. Would you be open to a quick chat? 

 Thanks, 


Victor Cheung
Inside Account Manager 

 We have the business solutions to help you 
operate in the new normal.
