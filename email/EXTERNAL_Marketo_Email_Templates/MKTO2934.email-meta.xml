    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 I want to introduce myself again, my name is Victor and I’ll be supporting your company’s account from now on. I want to take a moment to once again say an official hello.



 I’ve researched your company, and I’m thrilled to be working with you. I want to let you know that I have ideas on some solutions that I feel would benefit your business.

 I’d love to connect with you to discuss this. Are you available sometime for a quick chat? 

 Thanks, 


Victor Cheung
Inside Account Manager 

 We have the business solutions to help you operate in the new normal.
