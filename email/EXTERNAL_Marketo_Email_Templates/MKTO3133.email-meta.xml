    <subject>Grand &amp; Toy New Account Plans</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 Nice to meet you. My name is Jimmy, and from now on I’ll be your account manager at Grand &amp; Toy, and part of my role is to find better ways to serve you.

 I’ve reviewed your account and I noticed that you would benefit from updating to a new account plan.

 Grand &amp; Toy recently launched two plans that can help your business achieve increased savings. They are both free, no-contract plans that would provide you with a wide assortment of products with better than market pricing, helping your business save either 10% or 15% annually. You can compare the two plans here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Jimmy_Supporting_Your_Business_is_Our_Business.html]]&gt;.

 If you have any questions or don’t feel as though these two plans satisfy your needs, feel free to contact me so we can discuss 
a solution that’s right for you.

 Thanks, 


Jimmy Kyung
Inside Account Manager
