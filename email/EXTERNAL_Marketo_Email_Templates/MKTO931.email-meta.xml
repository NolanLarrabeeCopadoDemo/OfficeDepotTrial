    <textOnly>Good morning Andrew,

I hope all is well. I am wondering if you would have some time this month or next month to do an account review. I would like to ensure what we have on file is meeting your business needs as well as ensure we have the appropriate contacts on file as well. Please let me know when you would have approximately 20 minutes for me. Should you need anything in the meantime please let me know. Thank you and have a good day.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
