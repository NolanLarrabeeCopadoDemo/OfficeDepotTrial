    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

It’s Victor here once again, your new account rep.

 I’m looking forward to working with you. I see you didn’t respond to my previous emails, so I was wondering if there would be a better time to follow up with you this year? 

 Thanks, 


Victor Cheung
