    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I just wanted to quickly follow up on some notes I sent you in January on the sale we’re having. To help you make a decision, I’ve included a downloadable excel file &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/rs/720-MXC-641/images/Jan_SKU_Description_List_V3.xlsx]]&gt; that discusses these products’ key features. Just a reminder that the sale for these products ends on January 31, 2020.

 If you are looking for furniture, but these items are not what you’re looking for, feel free to reach out to me and I can help you find the right products that best suit your needs.</textOnly>
