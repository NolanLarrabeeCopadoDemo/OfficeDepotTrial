    <textOnly>Good afternoon Sandra,

I hope all is well with you today. I spoke with Sarah as I was informed that Samantha is on maternity leave right now and I told that you are taking over the office procurement for the time being. I am not sure if Samantha provided my contact information to you as I am your Account Manager with Grand &amp; Toy. If there is anything I can assist with please let me know. Thank you and have a good day. 



Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
