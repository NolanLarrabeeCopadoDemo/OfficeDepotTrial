    <subject>SAFETY ALERT FOR EPSON SCANNERS</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},
Epson has recently issued a recall on AC Adapters linked to certain Epson Perfection® Scanners (Models V30/ V33/ V37/ V300/ V330/ V370) sold between 2010 and 2017. These adapters can overheat, melt or ignite, potentially causing deformation of the DC plug, smoke, odor and in some cases, fire or property damage.
The issue here is rare and no injuries have been reported. However, in an abundance of caution, and out of concern for customer safety and satisfaction, please STOP using the supplied AC adapters immediately.
To confirm whether your scanner is impacted by this recall, carefully review and follow the instructions provided below. If these steps confirm your adapter is covered please contact Epson’s dedicated toll-free number 888-367-2656 (Monday – Friday 7 am – 5 pm) to receive a replacement.
How to identify impacted equipment:
If both (A) and (B) below are met, you have the target AC adapter.
A. The part number of the AC adapter (found on the label) is 
     “EADP-16CB B”
B. The manufacturing date of the AC adapter (found on the label) is
     “2010.01 to 2012.05”
Epson constantly monitors product performance and manufacturing practices to ensure their products are meeting the very highest standards and expectations of their customers.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
