    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

With everything that has been happening lately, social distancing has become an essential part of our everyday lives. This has resulted in all types of companies getting an increase in demand for their products &amp; services from their customers &amp; clients who are now remote. During this unique time, I want to make sure that you’re prepared. 

I want to remind you that Grand &amp; Toy provides mail, packaging &amp; shipping 
supplies &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/EN/search/pages/catalog/Mail-Pack-Ship/_/N-cwx?cmp=EBISOPACKINGSHIPPING20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;. If you missed our email about it – please check it out below. If you have any questions or want information about other solutions – please feel free to reach out to me.

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
