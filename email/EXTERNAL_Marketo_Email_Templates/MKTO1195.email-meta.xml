    <textOnly>Hi Alice,

It has been quite a while since we last spoke!  How are you doing?  
I just wanted to reach out to you to find out if you are still the person placing supply orders at Petrochina or if it someone else at this point?  We have a new Account Manager assigned to your account here in Calgary and I would like to bring him by for a quick meeting and introductions.  We have some great new samples to bring along as well and perhaps we could discuss some of the new pricing programs we have available to offer.

If you could just let me knwo if you are still the correct person we should be reaching out to and if not, who would be in charge of Office Supply Procurement, that would be great!

Best regards,

Jessica ShentonBusiness Development Manager | Alberta South 37 Aero Drive NE, Calgary, AB, T2E 8Z9
