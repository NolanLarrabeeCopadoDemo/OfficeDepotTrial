    <subject>Tips and Tricks for Efficient Procurement</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
 
You spend a lot of time finding the right products at the right price for your department and we want to help. Here are a few tips and tricks to make procurement easier, faster and efficient. 
 
 Get the Best Value
 You’re required to shop around and get the best products at the best value. As a RCMP employee we offer you great prices on thousands of office products so you can perform your best work every time. 
 
 Manage Your Spending
 Procurement for the Federal Government is a big responsibility with many rules, regulations and spending restrictions. Using our spend management tool, you’ll always know where money is being spent so you can cut costs, avoid unnecessary spend and always stay compliant. 
 
 Request Quotes
 Make procurement faster and easier with our online quoting tool, designed to provide you with fast quotes, easy approvals, and controlled spending. 
 
 Take Back Time
 Save time by allowing your team to shop for products while being in control with approval settings and spend limits. And with efficient reordering save even more time by quickly reordering your favourite products. 
 
 Avoid Downtime
 Sometimes you just run out of office supplies and everything goes on hold. With our fast and free shipping on most products you’ll never have to wait again. 
 
 Get Priority Support
 If something goes wrong, we’re here to help. Our customer support team is available Mon-Fri to make sure you get the service you deserve.
