    <textOnly>Hi Shirley,

I hope all is well with you today. I wanted to ensure you have my contact information as I am your Account Manager with Grand &amp; Toy. I was speaking with Jon a couple of weeks ago and he said that you would be a good person to speak with as well in regards to your business needs. I would like to schedule to some time with you to understand how we could support you in other areas of your business. Please let me know what day and time would be best to call you. Thank you for your time and have a good day.



Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
