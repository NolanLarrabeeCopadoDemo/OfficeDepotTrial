    <textOnly>Hi Angela,

I hope all is well with you today. I would like to schedule some time with you to obtain your toner and paper information as I am in the process of putting together a full solution for everyone. Could you let me know what day and time would be best to call you to obtain that information. Thanks so much for your time and I hope you&apos;re having a good summer so far. 

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
