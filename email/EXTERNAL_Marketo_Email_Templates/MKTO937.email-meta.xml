    <textOnly>Hello Don,

I hope all is well. My name is Lorne Sawyer and I am your dedicated Account Manager. I have been working with David Viola and he said to me that you would be the person I need to speak with in regards to the restructuring. I am would like to schedule some time with you to ensure what we have on file is up to date and meeting your business needs. Please let me know when you would have approximately 20 minutes for me to do this review. I look forward to your response and thank you for your time.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
