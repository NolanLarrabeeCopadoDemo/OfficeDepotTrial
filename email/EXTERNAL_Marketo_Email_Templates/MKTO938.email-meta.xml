    <textOnly>Hi Tracy,

I hope you&apos;ve been doing well.

​Further to my voicemail I left you a few moments ago: Have you had an opportunity to discuss G&amp;T helping your organization lower costs on supplies and make ordering simpler, with your Executive Director?

Perhaps the timing is not good for you and your organization? If that is the case, no worries at all, however, we also understand that everyone is very busy these days.

Please let us know how we can serve and support you and I look forward to hearing from you when it is convenient for you.

Take care
