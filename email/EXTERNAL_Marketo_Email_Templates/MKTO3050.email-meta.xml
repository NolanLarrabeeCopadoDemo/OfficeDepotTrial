    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I wanted to reach out one last time to continue my discussion with your back to work committee. When your business decides it’s the right time to open its office doors, it’s important to understand that things will not be the same. You will need to adapt to the new environment and have the right safety solutions in place to protect employees from risks and exposure related to viruses.

A risk you might not have considered is air quality. Did you know that typically it takes 45 minutes for the air to become clean between visitors? Air purifiers &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/EN/search/pages/browse/Air-Purifiers/_/N-dxd?scs=Air%20Purifiers?cmp=ISOAIRPURIFIERS20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt; can help with this as they clean the indoor air of public places, capturing 99.97% of airborne particles, including bacteria and viruses.

Another way to protect employees from potential exposure to viruses is using an elevated body temperature control chart. This device is your first line of defense against viral infection transmission. It can easily screen up to 30 people per second, identifying elevated body temperature that could be an indicator of fever or illness. Feel free to learn more about this product here &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/dcr/sites/core/tempcart.aspx??cmp=ISOBODYTEMPCART20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;.

To help you navigate what the new normal will be, I do 
have other safety solutions. Are you available for a quick chat to discuss this? If you&apos;re not part of the back to work committee, please forward my email to the right people or let me know who to contact so I can help keep your workforce safe. 

 Thanks!</textOnly>
