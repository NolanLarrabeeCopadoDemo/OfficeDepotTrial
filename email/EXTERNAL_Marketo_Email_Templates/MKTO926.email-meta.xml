    <textOnly>Hi Mashal,


I hope all is well with you today. I tried calling using the 449-4523 number and the receptionist could not transfer me. Would there be a different number I could use to call you? I was working on a few things with Simin and I hoping to schedule some time with you to review everything and see if we can proceed. Please let me know the best number to use to get a hold of you as well as when you would have some time for me. Thank you and have a good one.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
