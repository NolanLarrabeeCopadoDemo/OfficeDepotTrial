    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

Small business week is officially here, so I wanted to reach out to help you celebrate. To support this special week, I&apos;m sending you a promo code, SMBWEEK, which provides you with $10 OFF your order of $100 or more. You can use this promo until October 26th, 2020 on almost anything except bottled water, hardware, software, services and printing. Make sure to sign in to your account at https://www.grandandtoy.com/Account/Logon.
 
 
I also want to take this time to remind you that whether your 
back in the office &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/dcr/sites/core/back-to-business.aspx]]&gt; or if you continue to work from home &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/dcr/sites/core/wfh.aspx]]&gt;, Grand &amp; Toy has the products to sustain your business and keep your employees and customers safe.

I am here to provide my continuing support. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
