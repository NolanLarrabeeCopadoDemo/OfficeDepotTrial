    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
 
 
I know you must be busy running the office. In my previous email, I mentioned 2 new free pricing plans that would be better suited for you than your current outdated plan. 
Just a quick reminder that making the switch to one of these plans will give you the best prices on paper, toner and technology. 
I know that either one of these plans are better than your current plan because in addition to improved pricing you would also receive stronger offers on national brand products or Grand &amp; Toy private label products. I will also be personally assigned to you as your dedicated point of contact. 
When you make the switch, you will be provided with a 10% off coupon that you can use on your first purchase until December 20, 2019. 
Need a closer look at these new free pricing plans? You can check them out here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Nurture---WhiteSpace-PricingPlan_WhiteSpace-PricingPlan-Master.html]]&gt;. 
If you have any questions or don’t feel as though these 2 plans satisfy your needs, feel free to contact me. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
Sean Beauchemin
Inside Account Manager        900 Belfast Road, Ottawa, ON K1G 0Z7
