    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

Thank you for your patience, but due to the on-going supply shortage, 
your order of hand sanitizer is still on backorder.

 Hand sanitizers have been a hot topic in the news lately as numerous products were recalled for containing alcohol not approved for sanitizer use. As a valued Grand &amp; Toy customer, I want to ensure you have the right products to keep your employees safe. We only carry products that are Health Canada certified. I recommend the following alternatives that are in stock and available: 

 - ECOLogical Gel Hand Sanitizer  &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/ECOL-HSAN06_ECOLogical_Benzalkonium_Chloride_Gel_Hand_Sanitizer_with_Conditioning_Aloe%2c_Alcohol_Free%2c_300_mL.aspx?cmp=EBIAMBACKORDEREN2&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt; - this alcohol-free 
product is as effective as alcohol-based sanitizers

 - Cleace Hand Sanitizer &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/HT-HS501_Cleace_Hand_Sanitizer_with_Pump%2c_75_Alcohol_Content%2c_500_mL.aspx?cmp=EBIAMBACKORDEREN2&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt; - contains 75% alcohol


If you decide to purchase these alternative hand sanitizers and would 
like to cancel your existing hand sanitizer backorder, please respond to this email.

 Kindly let me know if there is anything else I can do for you. 

Best Regards,</textOnly>
