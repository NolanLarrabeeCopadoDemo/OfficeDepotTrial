    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

I hope you&apos;re doing well! I&apos;m not sure if you saw my previous email, but my name is Jimmy and I&apos;ll be supporting your company’s account from now on. I want to take a moment to once again say an official hello.




I’ve researched your company, and I’m thrilled to be working with you. I want to let you know that I’m here to listen to you and do my best to support all efforts to meet your needs.

 Are you available for a quick chat so we can connect over the phone?

 Thank you, 


Jimmy Kyung
