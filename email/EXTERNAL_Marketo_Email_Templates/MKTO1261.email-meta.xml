    <textOnly>Hi Marcia,

I hope all is well with you today and please forgive the delay in my response. I am told that we are working on something for the Children&apos;s Aid Society as a whole. Once those details are available I will be in touch. In the meantime, should you need anything from me please let me know. Thank you for your time and I hope you&apos;ve had a great week and you&apos;ll have a great weekend.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
