    <textOnly>Hi James,   Hope you are well, I visited your location in Halton Hills and was given your business card. I understand that you are traveling a fair bit and thought I’d reach out via email.   We are interested in doing business with Bolair and can help with your procurement in multiple categories like Facilities, PPE, Warehouse, and Office related supplies to name a few.   Would you be interested in a brief conversation to see if a partnership would be a fit?   Best regards,    Liz Rust Business Development Manager, Central Canada                       200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
