    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 My name is Jimmy, I’m new to the Grand &amp; Toy team and I’ve been assigned to support your company’s account, so I wanted to introduce myself.




 I want to learn more about your company in order to better support you on the necessary solutions to stay safe and productive.

 Are you available for a quick chat so we can connect over the phone?

 Thanks, 


Jimmy Kyung
