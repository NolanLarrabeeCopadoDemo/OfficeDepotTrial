    <textOnly>Hi, 
I wanted to provide some background on what Grand &amp; Toy can offer Select Engineering Consultants.  Traditionally I would suggest a discovery meeting to see what your needs are and identify areas where streamlining and consolidated purchase programs would help save on operational costs.  I figure if there is interest in these areas you would be open to a discussion.  In the meantime I wanted to share what we can offer small, medium and enterprise size clients.As Canada’s longest provider of business services, we understand that each organization is unique and needs proper support, products and confidence that they are getting the best value.  We also bring over 135 years of experience in working as a supply partner to some of the largest organizations in Canada all the way to the single business operating form home.  If you are wondering what Grand &amp; Toy can do for you, please feel free to reach out. To give you an idea of what we provide, please check out these links:
