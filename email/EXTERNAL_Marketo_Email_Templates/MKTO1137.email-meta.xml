    <textOnly>Hi Sherry,

I wanted to take this time to congratulate CHS on their acquisition of Ryan Medical Distributors Inc. This puts CHS in a great position for further growth in 2019 and beyond. 

Grand &amp; Toy can help the entire organization with managing their indirect spends during this exciting time, where you will need a partner who understands your needs.

We have spoken in the past about a potential partnership and I&apos;d like to facilitate an in person meeting to discuss what that could look like. 

Are you available the week of July 15th? Please let me know if a partnership with us is still a viable option for CHS to explore. 

Grand &amp; Toy is expanding our offering &amp; capabilities (below a link for context), we are more than just a products company!
