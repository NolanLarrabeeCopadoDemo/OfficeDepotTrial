    <textOnly>Hi Louisa,

I hope all is well with you today and thank you so much for your time on the phone with me, I appreciate it greatly. I will work on the list and be in touch with you in a couple of weeks as as I have to get a few things together. As I mentioned we do have our national brand of paper on contract for you. The following are the product codes to use:


OX9001, letter size paper, currently $37.90 per carton (box)

OX9004, legal size paper, currently $57.90 per carton

OX9007-0, ledger size paper, $45.65 per carton

When you are ordering the paper please ensure to change the unit of measure from package to carton. Once you do that it will show you the contract price. If there is anything I can do for you please let me know. Thank you again for your time and I hope you have a great afternoon.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
