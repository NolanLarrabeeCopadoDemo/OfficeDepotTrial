    <textOnly>Good morning Louisa,


I hope all is well and thanks so much for your time on the phone with me. I am your Account Manager with Grand &amp; Toy so please let me know if there are any business needs you may have as I can assist. I will send you a calendar invitation for Wednesday July 10th at 3:30 PM to do an account review, ensure what we have is meeting your business needs and update the contacts we currently have on file. Should anything come up let me know; otherwise, I am looking forward to our conversation. In the meantime, please reach out if I can be of assistance. Thank you again for your time and I hope you&apos;re having a good day.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
