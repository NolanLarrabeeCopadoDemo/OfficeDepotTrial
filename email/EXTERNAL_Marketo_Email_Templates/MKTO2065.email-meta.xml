    <subject>You Can Get Better Pricing</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
 
 
 
 
 
I’m Sean from Grand &amp; Toy and I am here to support your account. 
Recently, I have reviewed your account and I noticed that you are part of an outdated pricing plan that doesn’t offer you the best pricing on paper, toner and technology. 
I’ve been working hard with other companies who were in a similar situation and have helped them by providing them with a choice of two new pricing plans that offer better value for you. 
These free plans will provide you with better offers on national brand products or Grand &amp; Toy private label products, and improved pricing on paper, toner and technology. All you have to do is choose one based on what’s more important to you 
So, if you’re interested you can compare the 2 plans here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Nurture---WhiteSpace-PricingPlan_WhiteSpace-PricingPlan-Master.html]]&gt;. 

You’d be working with me if you were to make the switch as I am your dedicated point of contact. You can go back to your original plan at any time.

 If you have any questions or don’t feel as though these 2 plans satisfy your needs, feel free to contact me.  
Sincerely, 
Sean Beauchemin
Inside Account Manager        900 Belfast Road, Ottawa, ON K1G 0Z7
