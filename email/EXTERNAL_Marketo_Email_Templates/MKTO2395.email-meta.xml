    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 I just wanted to follow up – did you have a chance to think about updating your price plan to get better pricing on paper? By making the switch, you’d get access to 99115 Grand &amp; Toy Paper for $37.10 or OX9001 Boise paper at $42.90 along with other benefits. You can compare these two plans here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Paper-Campaign.html]]&gt;. 

 If you need more information or have any questions, please feel free to contact me. 

 Kind Regards,</textOnly>
