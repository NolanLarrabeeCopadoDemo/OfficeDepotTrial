    <textOnly>Hi Monina,

I hope all is well!  Have you done any stampeding yet?

I just wanted to touch base with you regarding the annual spend and the Staples invoices you were going to provide so that I can begin to complete a side by side pricing comparison for you and get you a new core list created.  Sorry I didn&apos;t follow up with you on that at the end of June, things got busy and I assume the same for you since I hadn&apos;t heard back yet!  The analysis I will prepare will show you the significant savings we can put into place for Secure and I look forward to working on that for you.

Let me know if you can gather that info to send over and I will get working on that right away!

Best regards,
