    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

My name is Deanna Giles and I’m your new Account Manager at Grand &amp; Toy.

 Like most people, you probably didn’t expect to be in your home office for the long-term and set up accordingly. With many organizations now moving towards working remotely for the remainder of the year, a lot of us are realizing we don’t have the right chair, desk, monitor, etc. to keep us going. We wanted to help, so we put together some affordable tools and resources that will ensure your success in your home office.

 If you’d like to take advantage of our WFH offerings and get your order delivered straight to your doorstep, you can sign up here &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/shopping/xt_login.aspx?username=wfhregion7dg&amp;password=wfhregion7dg&amp;Login]]&gt; with your personal email address. You’ll be asked to enter your credit card information when making a purchase and the priced packing slip provided with your order can be used for claiming a purchase or for income tax purposes.

 If you’re looking for a work from home plan for your entire department, please feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss a custom solution.

 As always, for 
day-to-day questions please contact our Federal Client Services Team at federalservices@grandandtoy.com. Hopefully you are ordering using grandandtoy.com 

Best Regards, 
 


Deanna Giles
National Account Manager - Federal Government | Gestionnaire de Compte - Gouvernement Fédéral
