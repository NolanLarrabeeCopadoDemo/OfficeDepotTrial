    <subject>AGF - G&amp;T Consolidation Discovery (1559946842.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>​Rick,


Thanks for taking the time to meet with Kevin and myself earlier this week. I believe our discussion demonstrated that Grand &amp; Toy has significantly expanded beyond our legacy business from 135+ years and that we bring compelling value to your business in the form of vendor consolidation not just nationally but across North America should it be required being that we are part of Office Depot (Parent Company).


You have a diverse workforce both in terms of demographics as well as geography. Just about half or less of your employees are in Toronto with the remaining spread throughout regional and satellite offices in Canada and some presence in the USA as well. The majority of the investment management team is in their mid-30s to early 60s, while your salesforce skews younger. You are keenly aware of the generational differences in how technology is used now at your firm and the anticipated needs of your future workforce at your future home at 81 Bay St and want to ensure the culture of AF is maintained and improved moving forward.


Putting aside the interiors’ conversation with Brad Haigh, here are high-level observations on key areas of your concerns:  
 	- Office Supplies: Next-day delivery, enhanced business services &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/OnlineRepository/dcr/landingpage/servicescentre/GT_Sales%20Toolkit_Services_EN.pdf]]&gt;, and optimal pricing are required.  	- Technology: This is a growing area of importance for AGF so having faster delivery to regional offices will be an advantage &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/OnlineRepository/dcr/landingpage/servicescentre/03%20-%20GT_SalesToolkit-Insert_8.5X11%20Competitive%20Edge%20-%20EN.pdf]]&gt;. 	- Coffee &amp; Breakroom: We believe there may be an opportunity for the firm to reduce costs while enhancing service levels &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/OnlineRepository/dcr/landingpage/servicescentre/04%20-%20GT_SalesToolkit-Insert_8.5X11%20Enhance%20Your%20Space%20-%20EN.pdf]]&gt; here 	- External Print: Branded collateral such as business cards, marketing invitations, and envelopes are in constant demand.  	- Paper: Due to the nature of your business, paper is in constant demand at high volumes. 	- Accounting: You require frictionless methods of distributing expenses to different cost-centers while maintaining visibility and reporting controls &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/OnlineRepository/dcr/landingpage/servicescentre/06%20-%20GT_SalesToolkit-Insert_8.5X11%20Simplify%20Your%20Purchases%20-%20EN.pdf]]&gt;. 	- Environmental: Green credentials are important. 
 

Above all, service and relationship is critical. Please let me know if I missed anything.My next steps are to obtain an e-introduction from you to other team members including Aafreen and Chris in order to discuss appropriate items (such as usage patterns and data) that would be relevant in the delivery of an extremely attractive proposal to win AGF’s trust and business. I am thinking we start with #1, 2, and 5 above to start as they are part of our legacy business and easy to implement.   Usage Data - best case scenario is 12 months usage in excel with product code, description and the # of times ordered. The easiest way to obtain is to ask your current supplier for this and advise them you need it as part of internal business reviews. This way, you don&apos;t have to do a lot of work trying to figure this out. Can we aim for obtaining these reports from you by June 21 (2 weeks time)? I will set up a follow up invite in our calendars to connect for 15 minutes.        Kind regards,Sal Ziauddin Business Development Manager - GTA Central    200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
