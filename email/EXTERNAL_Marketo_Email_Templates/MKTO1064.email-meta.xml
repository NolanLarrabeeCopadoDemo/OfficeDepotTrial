    <subject>Manage costs while you take advantage of the Egg Market Boom (1561604161.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Jason, The global egg market is expected to grow rapidly into 2023. How has Burnbrae positioned itself to take advantage? I know that when we last left off, we didn&apos;t have an opportunity to meet and understand your business completely. 
Indirect spend can quickly become a category that gets mismanaged. However, when addressed appropriately it can become a source of significant cost reduction and efficiency. Grand &amp; Toy can be the perfect partner to help you manage indirect spend. We&apos;re currently partnered with Hylife Farms and have helped them navigate the ups and downs of the commercial agriculture. I&apos;d like to set up a meeting with you to discuss what benefits of a partnership with G&amp;T would mean for Burnbrae.  Are you available on July 10th at 1pm? If this time does not work, please suggest an alternate. Looking forward to meeting you Jason. </textOnly>
