    <textOnly>HiÂ {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 


With the holidays quickly on their way, I just wanted to alert you that from December 24th - December 27th and January 1st we will not be making any deliveries. 

 Just a quick reminder that I have put together a special promo for you to use before the holidays. The promo is called, HOLIDAY, and provides you with 15% OFF your order of $75 or more. You can use this promo code until December 20th, 2019 on anything except paper.
