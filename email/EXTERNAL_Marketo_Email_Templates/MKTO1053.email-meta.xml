    <textOnly>Good afternoon Lisa, 

We spoke back in April, at that time you mentioned going through the hiring process for an Operations Manager. 

Briefly, we discussed a potential program that you may be eligible for (if you are a private or not for profit). It is called the OECM (Ontario Educational Collaborative Marketplace) with whom we are a vendor of record. The link to the website: https://oecm.ca/about-us &lt;[[https://oecm.ca/about-us]]&gt;

We&apos;ve had huge success with this program and we&apos;d like to share with you how it can help your organization&apos;s bottom line. 

Would you mind putting me in touch with the appropriate individual(s) so we can have an open dialogue?



Your assistance is greatly appreciated, 



Best regards, 

Liz Rust Business Development Manager, Central Canada   200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
