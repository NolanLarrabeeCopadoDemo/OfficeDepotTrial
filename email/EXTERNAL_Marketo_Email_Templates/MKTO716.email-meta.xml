    <textOnly>​Hello Jim,
 Throughout my conversations with organizations similar to yours, we have discovered that many organizations are becoming more aware of cardiovascular disease or heart disease, being the number one killer in Canada and accounting for 13% of all workplace deaths. With the amount of time we spend in the office, there is a higher potential then anywhere else for a sudden cardiac arrest to happen.  However, you may be thinking what can I do to assist? I do not have first aid training? What can I do to help save a life?
Fully Bilingual Cardiac Science&apos;s Automated External Defibrillators (AED) could assist you in saving a friend, colleague, manager, customer, employee during cardiac arrest! 

&quot;According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation (HSF), access to early CPR and defibrillation could potentially save the lives of thousands of Canadian adults and children each year.&quot;
