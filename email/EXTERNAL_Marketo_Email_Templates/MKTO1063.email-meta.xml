    <subject>Unfavourable Court Ruling Leaves You Seeking Cost Cutting Opportunities (1561602443.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Gowri​,

An Ontario Superior Court ruling made in January will force Mount Pleasant Group to make changes to your current business practices. What is the extent of this change? Are you looking for areas to cut cost?
 Indirect spend can quickly become a category that gets mismanaged. However, when addressed appropriately it can become a source of significant cost reduction and efficiency. Grand &amp; Toy can be the perfect partner to help you manage indirect spend. We&apos;re currently partnered with Arbor Memorial and have helped them navigate the ups and downs of the funeral services industry. I&apos;d like to set up a meeting with you to discuss what benefits of a partnership with G&amp;T would mean for Mount Pleasant Group.  Are you available on July 9th at 1pm? If the date and time do not work you, please let me know of a few favourable options. Looking forward to meeting you Gowri. </textOnly>
