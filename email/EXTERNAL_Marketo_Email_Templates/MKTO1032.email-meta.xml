    <subject>OECM Program - Buying power for Private schools (1561470524.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Good Morning Ron,


I am sending this email to give you some context around the OECM Program - below is a link to their website.

We would like to share with you how the program can be of financial benefit to your school. https://oecm.ca/about-us &lt;[[https://oecm.ca/about-us]]&gt;  

The program is absolutely free, I&apos;d be remiss to ask - Why not take advantage of a 20 million dollar buying program?



My colleague Joan and I will be at Beacon Christian School at 10am this Thursday (June 27th), would you be available for a brief conversation at 11am? 

We&apos;d like to drop by if you&apos;re available.



Please let us know if this would work for you. 


Regards, 
Liz Rust Business Development Manager, Central Canada   200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
