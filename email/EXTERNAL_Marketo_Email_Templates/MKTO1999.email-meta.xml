    <subject>Better Pricing Plans Are Ready for You</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
 


Sean from Grand &amp; Toy here once again. I’m reaching out one last time because I don’t want you to miss out on the amazing opportunity to update your outdated pricing plan.

As your account manager, I’ve been working hard to get you better pricing plans and have come up with two options that would be better suited for you. By making the switch you will get better paper pricing at either $37.10 on 9915 Grand &amp; Toy Paper or $42.90 on OX9001 Boise Paper. You will also get stronger offers on national brand products or Grand &amp; Toy private label products.

When you make the switch, you will be provided with a 10% off coupon on your first purchase which will be valid until December 20, 2019.

Need a closer look at these new free pricing plans? You can check them out here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Nurture---WhiteSpace-PricingPlan_WhiteSpace-PricingPlan-Master.html]]&gt;.

If you have any questions or don’t feel as though these 2 plans satisfy your needs, feel free to contact me.



Sincerely,

Sean Beauchemin
Inside Account Manager
