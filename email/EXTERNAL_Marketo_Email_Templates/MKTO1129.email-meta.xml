    <textOnly>Good morning Joyce,

I hope all is well. I am wondering if we could continue our conversation about your account with Grand &amp; Toy. Please let me know what day and time would be best to have this discussion with you. I would need approximately 20 minutes of your time. I am looking forward to your response.​ Have a great day.

Cheers,
