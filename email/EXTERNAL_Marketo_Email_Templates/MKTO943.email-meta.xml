    <textOnly>Hi Patrick,

As a follow-up to my voicemail yesterday (and for added context), I wanted to send you more detailed info on the program we&apos;d like to discuss.The OECM program (Ontario Educational Collaborative Marketplace). The website for the OECM is here, feel free to check it out  https://oecm.ca/ &lt;[[https://oecm.ca/]]&gt;  This program is 100% Free, there are no membership costs and it can help you achieve your financial goals as a school

We’ve more recently signed-up TriOS College, and Community Living Burlington (while not a school the program has been opened to Not for Profits as well) Many Private Schools have benefited from this program already, the schools we have met with have indicated they would like to see this program implemented before their next school/fiscal year to realize the cost benefits associated with this program.    Can we suggest a brief meeting with yourself on Tues June 18th at 1pm?   Let me know if you have any questions.   Best regards, 
Liz Rust Business Development Manager, Central Canada   200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
