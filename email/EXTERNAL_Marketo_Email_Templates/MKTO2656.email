 Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
<br /> 
<br />It’s Michael again. Just a reminder that I’m an inside account manager at Grand &amp; Toy. I noticed that you decided not to update your price plan. I understand that this could be a trying time to make a decision, but I really think the update will help your business out. 
<br /> 
<br /> Not only have I done extensive research, but I’ve recently received positive feedback from customers who have decided to make the switch. 
<br /> 
<br /> My goal in reaching out to you again is to make sure that you are able to achieve the same savings on essentials your business needs now and in the future, as these other accounts who have decided to update their plan. Just a reminder that these plans would provide you with savings that are usually reserved for larger businesses, with no contract and no annual fee. 
<br /> 
<br /> You’ll be able to save on solutions across all office essentials, including Paper and Cleaning &amp; Maintenance products. Plus, we’ll guarantee that you’ll save 10% to 15% each year by signing up. 
<br /> 
<br /> Need a closer look at these new price plans? You can check them out 
<a href="https://go.grandandtoy.com/Pricing-Plan_Price-Plan-April-2020-Michael.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #007000; font-weight: 600;">here</a>. To make the switch, simply click on the plan that works best for your business and your price plan will be updated within 1-2 business days. You’ll receive a confirmation email once the set-up has been completed. 
<br /> 
<br /> Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I’m working from home and would love to talk! 
<br /> 
<br /> Kind Regards,
