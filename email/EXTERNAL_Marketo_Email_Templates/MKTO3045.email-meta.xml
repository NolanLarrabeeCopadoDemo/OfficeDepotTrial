    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

Now more than ever, I want to recognize your ability to go above and beyond to meet the changing needs of the workplace. Stepping outside of your regular duties by taking on the responsibility to ensure the health &amp; safety of you and your colleagues does not go unnoticed. 

Here is a small token of appreciation as we celebrate Administrative Professionals Day on April 22nd. 

Use code ADMINDAY for $10 off your purchase of $75 or more until April 26th, 2020. 

As a bonus, you can use this code on critical COVID-19 signage for your workplace – like social distancing floor decals, vinyl clings and glossy posters. Simply sign in and go to the link https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/dcr/sites/core/covidsignage &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/dcr/sites/core/covidsignage?cmp=EBISOSIGNAGE20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;. I’ve attached a flyer &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/rs/720-MXC-641/images/COVID-19 SignageBrochure_EN.pdf]]&gt; that provides more information on the kinds of signs available. 

Thank you for everything you do! Please let me know if I can be of any assistance to make your work life easier. Kind Regards, 

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
