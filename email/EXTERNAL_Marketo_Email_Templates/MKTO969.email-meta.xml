    <textOnly>Hi Jason,


I hope all is well with you today. As I mentioned I was able to bring the paper down to $42.00 per carton. Given the recent increases I was not able to completely match the previous price. The product code to use for the paper is OX9001. This is the letter size paper. Same quality and same as you have previously ordered. I will advise as soon as I receive something back from my team about the 10 stamps you&apos;re looking to order. Thank you and have a good afternoon.



Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
