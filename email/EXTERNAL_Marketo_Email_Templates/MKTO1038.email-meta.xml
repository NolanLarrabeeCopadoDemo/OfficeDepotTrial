    <textOnly>Hi Michel,

I hope all is well with you today. I am wondering if you&apos;ve had a chance to review your old orders or invoices to let me know what you purchased. I do apologize as I cannot find anything on my end. Perhaps you can send me a picture of what is you currently have and I&apos;ll see if I can conform. Thank you and have a good day.



Cheers,
