    <textOnly>Good afternoon Alexandra,

I hope all is well and thank you again for your time on the phone with me. As I mentioned I am your Account Manager with Grand &amp; Toy and I can assist with your business needs. I will be in touch once I have everything in regards to what we currently have on file for you and your purchasing habits. Also, should you need something for the following business day please ensure to completely process your order on the website by 2:15 pm. When on the website you can change the shipping requirement from all to fastest and this would be on the top left corner of the website and this will refine the search so show what is available right away. We do have items that do take longer than one day to be delivered and this is referenced underneath of the unit of measure. Should you have a bulk order please let me know as this is when I  would need to work with my buyer to get everything in place. Should there be anything that I can do please let me know. I will be in touch once I have everything. Thank you again and have a good afternoon.

Cheers,

Lorne Sawyer
