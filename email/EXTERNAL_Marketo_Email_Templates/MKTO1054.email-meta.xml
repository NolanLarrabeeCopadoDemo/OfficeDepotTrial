    <textOnly>Hi Kendra,

I hope all is well with you today. I has been some time since I have reached out and I wanted to ensure all is going well and confirm with you that Rebecca is still the primary contact for this account as I noticed that you have been placing the order recently. Please let me know and feel free to let me know if there is anything that I can help with. Thank you so much and have a good afternoon.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
