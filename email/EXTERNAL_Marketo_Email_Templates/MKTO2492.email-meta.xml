    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 I wanted to reach out because I was reviewing your account and I noticed that you haven&apos;t bought paper in a while. I think this has to do with being a part of an outdated pricing plan that doesn’t offer you the best pricing on paper. 

 I’ve come up with two different pricing plans I think you would benefit from. Pricing plan 1 will provide you with better paper pricing at $37.10 for 99115 Grand &amp; Toy paper, along with stronger offers on Grand &amp; Toy brand products. And pricing plan 2 will provide you with better paper pricing at $42.90 on OX9001 Boise paper, along with stronger offers on national brand products. 

 If you’re interested, you can compare these two plans here &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/Paper-Campaign.html]]&gt;. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. 

 Thanks,</textOnly>
