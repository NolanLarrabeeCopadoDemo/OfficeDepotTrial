    <textOnly>​Good morning Jennifer,

I apologies if this is the first time you are receiving this email. I sent it last week right after you and I spoke however, my new email platform may have not sent it properly.

On our call, we discussed the following next steps.

Next Steps: - Account Application Form (see attached in separate email to follow) Please fill out the following 1) Business Information 2) Contact Information 3) Additional Information 4) Account Agreement - Signature on the bottom of the form   Then email it back to me and I will submit this right away.   These items could be a great start for us to add to your program at competitive pricing.   1) Garbage Bags 2) Inks/Toners  3) Coffee and Breakroom Supplies 4) Facilities Supplies, such as janitorial supplies, equipment (Mop Buckets, mops etc), Cleaners/Chemicals etc 5) Office Supplies   Which items are important to you? May you please send over some past invoices? We can then take a look at the sku#’s and cross them to our stocked sku’s and show you some pricing.   I will email you the account application in a 2nd email.   Thank you, Jennifer.   Tomas Hansen Business Development Manager, Corporate Sales | Lower Mainland, BC 4560 Tillicum St. | Burnaby BC Canada | V5J 5L4 E-mail: tomashansen@grandandtoy.com &lt;[[mailto:tomashansen@grandandtoy.com]]&gt; | Mobile: 604-649-2145 | Web: grandandtoy.com &lt;[[http://grandandtoy.com/]]&gt;  TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS | COFFEE AND BREAKROOM SUPPLIES | OFFICE SUPPLIES | INTERIORS AND FURNITURE | FACILITY CLEANING SUPPLIES | PROCUREMENT STREAMLINING SOLUTIONS CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The content of this e-mail (and attachments, if any) is privileged and confidential, and intended solely for its designated recipient(s).
