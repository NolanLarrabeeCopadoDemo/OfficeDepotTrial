    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

We have seen a big shift over the past few days in that many companies are urgently seeking for their associates to work from home. 
 
At Grand &amp; Toy, we are operating as an essential service and as such are continuing to supply our 300+ hospital customers across Canada as well as a variety of critical care providers like Police, Fire, Grocery, and Logistics providers. As an essential service provider we are working hard to support these organizations and remain open for business.
 
In support of the massive shift to work from home, we are doing our part to help out our customers by offering a helping hand as they seek to get set up, at home.  

So, we have created 
a promo code called HOME2020, which provides you with 10% OFF your order of $100 or more. You can use this promo code only 
once on Everyday Use Office Products and Ready to Ship Furniture. The code is not valid on bottled water, paper or technology. Make sure to sign into your account at https://www.grandandtoy.com/Account/Logon &lt;[[https://info.grandandtoy.com/dc/y7ePSX_e2MfsHQVakZvqHRFD6F04SJVJvRg395-Zk6fMInrysBTeRN4zPMSEsTmzjd9Z8wEeBPpyEJ59Yu0gpTWOoD7hdxd_ZKejTJyIEbBqzYFvKtW_94nuaxIGoweh1dVTdPByfInntSLPi0BfypdO5jahWJqSC_JhwWzLQKlyjsNaEA8oNNo0HPzyp02lAJHtOhsNJFNPEJ5cvvZN10n0pyLl_xRLU0T4pieTPjiehnXWSNhFU2ftaf1Jz4PTsYFh6fZcyi0ZOR53VfYlbzOBI5PB47d8WkfXaiBUvrA=/a0300f0e0M0000aCnXts001]]&gt; to take advantage of this offer. Please feel free to encourage your team to create new accounts and share the promo code with them.
