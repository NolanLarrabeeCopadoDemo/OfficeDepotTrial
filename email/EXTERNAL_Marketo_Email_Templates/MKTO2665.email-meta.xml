    <textOnly>Good Morning {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I wanted to connect with you because recently, I’ve had an influx of back to work committees from companies like yours reaching out to me to discuss how to properly navigate a changing office environment. During these conversations, companies have voiced their concerns around how to properly communicate the right safety measures to employees and how to keep the office sanitized despite traditional safety solutions selling 
fast. Luckily, we do have solutions available.

 To ensure you are communicating the right safety measures to employees when your business is prepared to open-up, investing in effective COVID-19 signage will be essential to keep your employees and customers safe. You can check out some options here &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/dcr/sites/core/covidsignage?cmp=EBISOSIGNAGE20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;.

And when it comes to sanitizing 
the office there are alternative safety solutions on the market.  &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/DB72000_Dustbane_Victory_Cordless_Handheld_Electrostatic_Sprayer.aspx?mode=direct&amp;?cmp=ISODUSTBANE20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;I want to introduce you to 
the &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/DB72000_Dustbane_Victory_Cordless_Handheld_Electrostatic_Sprayer.aspx?mode=direct&amp;?cmp=ISODUSTBANE20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt; Dustbane Electrostatic Sprayer &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/DB72000_Dustbane_Victory_Cordless_Handheld_Electrostatic_Sprayer.aspx?mode=direct&amp;?cmp=ISODUSTBANE20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;. It comes in two different sizes and it allows you to spray your office to disinfect, sanitize and remove odors within 2- 10 minutes. Feel free to learn more about it by downloading the PDF &lt;[[https://go.grandandtoy.com/rs/720-MXC-641/images/Victory-Brochure-en-sm-1.pdf]]&gt;. If you would like to order the product 
you will have to contact me, as it is not available for purchase online.

We do have more safety solutions available. Are you available this week to discuss? I’m working from home and would love to chat! If you&apos;re not the right person to discuss this with, please forward my email to 
the people involved in your back to work committee or let me know who to contact. 

 Thanks!</textOnly>
