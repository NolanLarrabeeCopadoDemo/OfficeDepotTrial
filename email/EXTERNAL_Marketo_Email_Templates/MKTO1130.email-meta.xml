    <textOnly>Hi Laura,

I hope all is well with you and that you had a good Canada Day long weekend. I am in the process of getting everything together and I am wondering if you have had a chance to review the report I sent you and confirm for me what would be your core supplies you use. As discussed I would focus on the largest quantities and go from there. Please let me know so I can ensure to include everything. Thanks again and have a great day.

Cheers,

Lorne Sawyer
