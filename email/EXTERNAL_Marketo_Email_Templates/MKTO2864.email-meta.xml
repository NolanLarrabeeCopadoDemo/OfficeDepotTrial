    <subject>Mandatory Masks - We’re in this together!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

 In these uncertain times, I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. 

 Due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, municipalities in Alberta are making or have made masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces and I know many businesses are struggling to adjust. If your business is one of them, I just wanted to reach out and let you know that Grand &amp; Toy currently has a large inventory of face masks to support your needs. Our masks have gone through rigorous testing to ensure high quality and compliance with Canadian health standards. 

 As a business, you’re under additional scrutiny to ensure masks or face coverings are being worn in your space – i.e. face coverings for all your employees and visitors is your responsibility. To help, we’ve discounted our masks and are offering 3 boxes for $99.99 for a limited time. 

 If you have any questions or would like to place an order, please feel free to reach out. 

 Best Regards,  
 
David Biggs
Account Manager
