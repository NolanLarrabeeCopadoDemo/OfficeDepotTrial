    <textOnly>Hello John,

it was a pleasure speaking with you today. As discussed, my colleague and I would like to have an open dialogue about your procurement and how we can help.

If the week of Aug 19th works, let me know what day works best for both yourself and Jen D&apos;Cunuha and we&apos;ll accommodate. 

Below is a link to our website, specifically the Health &amp; Safety section, but free to look around. 

If there is someone that looks after Facility supplies it&apos;d be great to have them at the meeting as well.

Looking forward to meeting with you, have a great summer.


Best regards,
