<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, <br /><br /> I wanted to reach out to you again because golf facilities are now open, and I have the tools and knowledge to help you manage this new normal. While there is a lot you need to adhere to, a key aspect is implementing the necessary physical distancing guidelines to keep everyone safe. <br /><br />To communicate the necessary physical distancing guidelines, you will need to have visible signage throughout your facility. Grand &amp; Toy does carry the type of <strong><span style="color: #007000;"><a href="https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/dcr/sites/core/covidsignage.aspx?cmp=HPCOVSIGNAPR2020EN?cmp=EBNIAMSIGNAGE20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007000;">signage</a></span></strong> you need including floor decals, vinyl clings and glossy posters. Iâ€™ve attached a <strong><span style="color: #007000;"><a href="https://go.grandandtoy.com/rs/720-MXC-641/images/COVID-19 SignageBrochure_EN %281%29.pdf" target="_blank" id="" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007000;">flyer</a></span></strong> that provides more information on the kinds of signs available. I want to remind you that being part of NGCOA does give you preferential pricing.<br /><br /> If you would like to discuss this further or if you want information on other solutions that will help with the daily operations of your golf facility, please feel free to reach out to me.<br /><br />Thanks,</p>
