    <textOnly>Hi Sandra,

I hope all is well. I called and they said that you will be leaving soon so I thought I would email you as it has been some time since we have spoken. I wanted to ensure that everything is going well and see if there is anything we need to discuss about your business needs. Please let me know. Thank you and have a great Canada Day long weekend.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
