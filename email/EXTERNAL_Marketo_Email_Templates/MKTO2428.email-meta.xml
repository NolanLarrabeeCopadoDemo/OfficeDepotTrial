    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I’m Lorne, Denise’s colleague. She’s away right now and didn&apos;t want you to miss out on this important information, so she asked me to reach out to you on her behalf. 
With the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a shortage of cleaning products everywhere. Despite the shortage, Grand &amp; Toy does have cleaning products available that can help protect your office from germs &amp; viruses. You can check out these products here. &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/EN/search/pages/browse/_/N-BWW?cmp=ISODENISECLEANINGMAREN&amp;utm_source=Marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Lets+chat+about+cleaning&amp;utm_campaign=2020+03+10+-+ISO+Cleaning+-+Mar+Email]]&gt; 
I just want to remind you that not all disinfecting wipes have the same kill time and it&apos;s important to read the label on the product to ensure the surface is wet for the right amount of time to either sanitize or disinfect the surface. While many people use the words sanitize and disinfect interchangeably, there is a difference between them. Disinfecting a surface kills germs and viruses, while sanitizing reduces germs and bacteria. With COVID-19 on the rise I suggest you read the label on the product carefully to make sure that you’re disinfecting rather than sanitizing the surface.  
If you have any questions or need more 
information on how to properly use a product, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I’d be happy to help. 

Kind regards,</textOnly>
