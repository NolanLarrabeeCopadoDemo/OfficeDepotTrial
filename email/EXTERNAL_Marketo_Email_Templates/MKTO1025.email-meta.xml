    <textOnly>Hi Laura,

I hope all is well with you today and thank you so much for your time on the phone with me, I appreciate it greatly. I will work on your list and ensure to capture the top 10 items that have the largest quantities to ensure it is quite competitive for you. Please review the list and let me know if there is anything else that needs to be added. Also, if you could confirm for me the volume of which you order the break room supplies; the coffee, the tea and the other stuff. That would be great too. If there is anything else I can do please let me know. Thanks again for your time and I hope you have a good day.

Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
