    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I hope that you are continuing to stay healthy and safe during this trying time.

 As conditions continue to shift daily, the way we work continues to be redefined, with 
safety being the utmost important. I wanted to bring to light an issue that you may not be aware of - keyboards and mice are a high source for pathogens and cross-contamination that could lead to infections. In fact, bacteria can live on computer keyboards for up to 6 weeks! 

Having the right equipment in place is important to avoid these situations. That’s why I want to introduce you to Seal Shield’s keyboards 
&amp; mice &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/EN/search/pages/browse/Medical-Keyboards-Mice/Seal-Shield/_/N-1z0c0tfZcuy?cmp=EBISOSEALSHIELD20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;. These technology accessories are priced like standard keyboards but have unique features. They are washable and equipped with antimicrobial product protection. This means that they can withstand harsh disinfectants such as bleach and they are dishwasher safe. Feel free to check them out here &lt;[[https://www.grandandtoy.com/EN/search/pages/browse/Medical-Keyboards-Mice/Seal-Shield/_/N-1z0c0tfZcuy?cmp=EBISOSEALSHIELD20EN&amp;utm_source={{my.UTM Source}}&amp;utm_medium={{my.UTM Medium}}&amp;utm_content={{my.UTM Content}}&amp;utm_campaign={{my.UTM Campaign}}]]&gt;.

 If 
you have any questions or want to talk – please feel free to reach out to me. 

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
