    <subject>David, when can we meet? (1559077152.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>David, 

I&apos;m following up on our previous conversations about how we can help you consolidate your supply lines and reduce indirect spending. 

What&apos;s your best availability next week if I want to drop by for an exploratory conversation?​

It&apos;s a win-win for you - you either get a consolidated supplier with better pricing and enterprise-grade platforms, or you get confirmation that your existing strategy is the best course.  


Please advise. 

Kind regards, 
 Sal Ziauddin Business Development Manager - GTA Central 200 Aviva Park Dr, Vaughan, ON   L4L 9C7
