    <subject>How ergonomic is your setup? Find out!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 
 
 Sitting all day, working with computers might be considered a low risk work environment, however it comes with very real health risks that can lead to long term health problems like musculoskeletal disorders. This makes ergonomics a high priority. Do you know how ergonomic your office setup is? 

 Complete the ergonomic assessment quiz &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/J8KWZWN]]&gt; to find out.
