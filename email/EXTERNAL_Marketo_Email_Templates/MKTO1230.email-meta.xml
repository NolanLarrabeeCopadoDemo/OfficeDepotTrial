    <textOnly>Hello Talia,

I hope all is well. I left a message for you using 663-5602 phone number; however, the voicemail message said that it is Laura. I hope this is conveyed to you. I received the quote our customer service team provided you with and I would like to lend my assistance with ensuring we get everything to you in a timely fashion. Could you give me a call or let me know what number would be best to reach you at so I can gather the details necessary for the delivery. Please let me know. Thank you for this opportunity and I look forward to your response. Have a great day.



Cheers, 

Lorne Sawyer
