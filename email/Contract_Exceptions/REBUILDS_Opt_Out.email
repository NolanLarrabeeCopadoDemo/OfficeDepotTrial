Hello <Sales Rep Name>,
In order to opt <Company> out of price increases, we require <leader’s title> approval. We have included <leader’s name> on this response to provide appropriate approval.  As soon as we receive that response, we will confirm that <Company> has been opted out.  If we do not receive a response in 4 business days, we will close out this request, and the customer will remain in rebuilds.  Let us know if there are any questions.

Thank you,
OD Rebuild Team
