Hello <Sales Rep Name>,

To confirm, are you asking to remove the items from their core list? If so, please reach out to the Account Maintenance Team to have the items removed from the core. An Account Maintenance request may be generated by clicking on the SCOE Support button in the Account Detail view. From there, select Pricing Maintenance> Core Creation, Revision, or Deletes.

However, if you are asking for the items to be disregarded this quarter for rebuilds, we can go over the approval process for that.

If you have the items removed, please let us know, and we can then make sure they don't get changed. Please let us know.

Thank you,
OD Rebuilds
