Hi {!Case.WRF_Requestor__c} 

We will require an email from the customer stating they are a punch out and use a system that does not allow for an MOV. 

Once obtained please save as a .PDF or .eml or .msg document (see attached instructions) and send back to Contract.Exceptions@officedepot.com in this email chain. 

As a friendly reminder, please do not forward our emails to the customer as our emails and email addresses are for internal Office Depot use only. 

Please note, I can only hold this ticket open pending this information for 2 days. If we do not receive what is needed by EOB (5 pm Eastern) on xx/xx/2020, I will need to reject this ticket and have it cancelled. If that happens you would then be required to open a new SFDC ticket with the required documents when you are ready. 

Thanks
