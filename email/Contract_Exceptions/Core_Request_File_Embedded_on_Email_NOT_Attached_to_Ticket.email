Hi {!Case.WRF_Requestor__c} 

I see that you attached the customerâ€™s approval/notification (select one) to the SFDC ticket however, after review, there is no way to confirm that the items being added/updated/deleted to this core is what the customer is approved/notified (select one) since the file referred to is embedded within that PDF and cannot be opened. 

Please send the file named: 

Do not rename this file in any way.  

Please note, I can only hold this core open pending this information for 2 days. If we do not receive what is needed by EOB (5 pm Eastern) on xx/xx/2020, I will need to deny this core and have this ticket cancelled. If that happens you would then be required to open a new SFDC ticket with the required documents when you are ready.
