    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Understanding that INSERT COMPANY NAME is a global organization centered in North America, I am confident that Business Solutions at Office Depot with strong presence in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. can deliver a superior program to your organization. With the recent acquisition of CompuCom, a comprehensive technology services company, we can offer you a rich business platform that includes everything from office supplies and breakroom solutions to furniture and technology services.



I respectfully request the opportunity to meet. My goal is to learn about your program so that I may offer a solution that will help INSERT COMPANY NAME optimize (and leverage) its global program. Would you be available for a meeting INSERT DATE? I appreciate your consideration.



Thank you,
