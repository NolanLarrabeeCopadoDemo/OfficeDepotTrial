    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

My name is INSERT YOUR NAME.  I am a business development executive with Office Depot with a focus solely on enterprise accounts. I am sure you get emails like this all the time, but this one has the potential to drive real value to your organization.

I have been going over your vision statement &quot;INSERT VISION STATEMENT&quot;. It struck me as a philosophy very similar to Office Depot&apos;s, which is why I am contacting you.



At Office Depot, we partner with customers to drive real value. We have transformed into a full business platform that includes offering our customers a full technology services offering. We have the potential to impact business in a much different way. As an example, I easily saved one of my clients $155,000 a year.  By my calculations, if we were to do the same thing for INSERT COMPANY NAME, you could realize a cost reduction that would equate to a net sales increase of over $X.X million annually (based on your net margins from 2017).  Should you achieve that net increase in sales AND reduce the costs at the same time, the impact would be significant.

May I have some time to sit with you or someone on your team to discuss how Office Depot can help INSERT COMPANY NAME? I am available to meet INSERT DATE AND TIME. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.



Thank you,
