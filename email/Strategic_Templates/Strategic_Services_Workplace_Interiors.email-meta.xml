    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

INSERT COMPANY NAME investment in its facilities speaks highly of your organization and its commitment to your employees and the community!


I value the chance to be a part of your future needs.

My goal is to learn about your interiors/facilities program, and determine how Office Depot may be a resource to INSERT COMPANY NAME. Respectfully, I am requesting a meeting or a contact for the appropriate person in your organization with whom I can request a meeting. I am available to meet INSERT DATE AND TIME. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.
