    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I understand that INSERT COMPANY NAME recently acquired INSERT COMPANY NAME.


With the changes to your organization, as well as significant growth over time through acquisitions, now is a good time for a Market Validation, which I am happy to provide to you as a courtesy. So that I can deliver an accurate Validation, I would like to understand how you operate today, and the changes you&apos;d like to make. Iâ€™d also like the opportunity to showcase our full capabilities via our recent acquisitions as well. Business Solutions at Office Depot can offer you a rich business platform that includes everything from office supplies and breakroom solutions to furniture and technology services.



I am available to meet on INSERT DATE AND TIME.  If there is a more convenient time, please propose. Thank you for your time.

Thank you,
