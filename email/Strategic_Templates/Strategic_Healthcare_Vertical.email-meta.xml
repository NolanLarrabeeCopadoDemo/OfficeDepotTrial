    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I am a Director of Business Development at Office Depot.  We have had great success working with healthcare systems and collaboratives over the past few years. As an example, weâ€™ve implemented programs with members of Novation-VHA collaboratives: Midwest Purchasing Coalition, Heartland, and Friendship-7 Sourcing Collaboratives. Clients in these programs realized savings of up to 30% from their prior programs.

I respectfully request the opportunity to meet. My goal is to learn about INSERT COMPANTY NAME goals and initiatives surrounding office-related programs. Are you available to meet the week of INSERT DATE?

Thank you for your consideration.



Thank you,
