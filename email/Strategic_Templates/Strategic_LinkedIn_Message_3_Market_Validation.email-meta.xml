    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I located your name on LinkedIn.  I understand that INSERT COMPANY NAME reviewed its supply program in late 2013. Since that time, the office services industry has changed greatly and so has Office Depot—consolidation of major players, enhanced insight, visibility, compliance tools, paper at a two-year low, category expansion driving client leverage.

Respectfully, I am requesting a meeting to discuss the following:


INSERT COMPANY NAME overall strategy
Industry trends
Why a Market Validation makes sense


I am available to meet on INSERT DATE AND TIME. If there is a more convenient time, please propose.  I appreciate your consideration.



Thank you,
