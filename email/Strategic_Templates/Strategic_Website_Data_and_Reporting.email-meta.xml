One way we do this is via on-demand reporting through your personalized ordering website business.officedepot.com.

This exclusive and innovative self-service tool gives you real-time access to your account information and spending patterns so you can quickly identify savings opportunities and manage your bottom line. You no longer need to wait weeks for the reports you need. At Office Depot, we believe strongly that your data belongs in your hands! Your dashboards along with quarterly business reviews with your account manager, allow us to partner and reduce your spend. We work with you to ensure you stay on track and accomplish your goals.
