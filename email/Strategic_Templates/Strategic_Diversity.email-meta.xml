    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

From the INSERT COMPANY NAME website, I understand your organization&apos;s commitment to Supplier Diversity. Office Depot has a long history of commitment to increasing economic opportunities of diverse supplier partners. We were a founding member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).



I respectfully request the opportunity to meet and learn how diversity initiatives cross over into supplier programs. I would like to share how Office Depot promotes diversity within our company, our products, partners and customers. I am available to meet INSERT DATE AND TIME. I appreciate your consideration.



Thank you,
