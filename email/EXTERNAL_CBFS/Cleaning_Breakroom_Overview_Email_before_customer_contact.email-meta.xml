Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
Did you know that Office Depot® has so much more than office supplies? We also carry a complete selection of cleaning, breakroom and facilities solutions to keep your workspace spotless and your employees energized throughout the day. Choose from all this and much more:
• Gourmet coffees, brewers and supplies
• Full-service filtered water systems
• Candies, cookies and healthy snacks
• Soaps and sanitizers
• Tissues and towels
• Cleaners and chemicals
• Heavy-duty cleaning equipment and accessories
Why not save time and get everything for your business all in one place? That can mean fewer deliveries, less impact on the environment, and most importantly … more savings!
Be sure to check out the customized digital presentation I put together for you.
Thanks again for your business! Meeting and exceeding your needs is our #1 goal.
