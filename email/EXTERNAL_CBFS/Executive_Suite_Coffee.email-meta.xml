Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
I want to take a minute to let you know  about a delicious way to save! Our exclusive brand of coffee, Executive Suite®, offers the national brand quality that your employees are craving — at a price that you and your budget will love.
From the rich boldness of Seattle Roast to the delightful fusion of Donut Shop Blend, there’s a gourmet flavor to satisfy everyone in the office.
Plus we roast, grind and package every order on a weekly basis — so each one achieves its full potential and taste profile.

Please view the customized digital presentation that I put together for you.

Let me know if you’d like any more information, or if you’d like to try a sample or two. I’d be happy to send them to you!
Sincerely,
{!User.Name}
