    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Name},

My name is {!User.Name}. I am your representative and point of contact for the Business Solutions Division at Office Depot. I just left you a voice mail, and I really want to thank you for coming by our booth at ISTE.


We displayed our Collaborative Classroom solutions with furniture and technology at the show. You might have seen the flexible seating and our latest technology items like Virtual Reality, Drones, and Displays.


When you start to look for classroom solutions including technology or even curriculum and content, please let me know. I can set up an introductory meeting with one of our Educational Consultants who has spent time in the classroom. Our consultants help integrate your needs with Office Depot services. I also invite you to visit our website for education customers at www.ODC2L.com. The site showcases many of our educational solutions. Thanks again for stopping by at ISTE.




Thank you,
