    <subject>Deviated Cost 60 Day Expiration Notification: {!Deviated_Cost__c.Account_Name__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Deviated_Cost__c.Account_Owner_Name__c},

The Deviated Cost Agreement for &apos;{!Deviated_Cost__c.Account_Name__c}&apos; ends in 60 days on {!Deviated_Cost__c.End_Date__c}. It is imperative that you contact the Vendor ({!Deviated_Cost__c.Vendor__c}) to ensure timely renewal to prevent rebate delays.

If the Deviated Cost Agreement is not renewed, then core pricing must be updated to reflect loss of deviation! Please note: this will affect your compensation.

When applicable, please follow the link below to update the &apos;Rep Disposition&apos; field on the Deviated Cost page (disposition options are: Deviated Cost Review, Extension Granted, and No Extension - Deal Ended).

Sincerely,
Deviated Cost Team
