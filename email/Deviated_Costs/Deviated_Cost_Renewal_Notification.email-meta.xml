    <textOnly>Dear {!Deviated_Cost__c.Account_Owner_Name__c},

Thank you for ensuring the Deviated Cost Agreement for &apos;{!Deviated_Cost__c.Account_Name__c}&apos; was renewed.

Please be sure to review the new agreement and confirm that there are no changes to rebates and product assortment. In order to prevent margin erosion, we recommend that you submit a WRF to ensure customer pricing reflects correct rebates.

Sincerely,
Deviated Cost Team
