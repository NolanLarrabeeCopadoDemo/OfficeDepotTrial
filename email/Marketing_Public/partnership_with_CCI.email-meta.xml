    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


It is with great excitement that Office Depot announces our partnership with the Common Core Institute (CCI), a partnership organization linking specialists in College &amp; Career Readiness strategies with experts in Common Core Standards!


Office Depot has always been a great partner in providing quality products and solutions for schools to operate efficiently.  Now, Office Depot is equipped to provide thought leading content and job embedded tools.


We&apos;d like to invite you to attend next month&apos;s free Common Core Institute webinar sponsered by Office Depot.


Rigor in the Common Core is defined by Depth of Knowledge or Complexity.  But, where do we start?  How do we know WHAT TO TEACH FIRST and HOW TO TEACH IT to the targeted DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE?


The biggest &quot;shift&quot; in the Common Core Standards is the significant increase in cognition and complexity - known as &quot;Dept of Knowledge&quot;.  Student performance on new assessments depends especially on the ability to synthesize multipule sources of information and complete advanced writing tasks.  This is true for the upcoming revised SAT, the ACT, the new Advanced Placement cources, as well as Common Core-aligned assessments, like those in New Yourk State and Kentucky and PARCC and Smarter Balanced.


In this special one-hour webinar with live Q&amp;A, Kevin Baird - Chairman at the Center for College &amp; Career Readiness - dives deeply into the key requirements of the Common Core Standards, looking at the specific priority standards and their depth of knowledge requirements.  From there, we look at critical strategies to meet those requirements - very specific instructional methods and support tools to meet those requirements.


Mr.  Baird will also be announcing a new round of funding support to help districts and schools implement the Common Core State Standards.  &quot;Connecting Depth of Knowledge with Common Core Standard&apos;s Requirements.&quot;


Reserve your seat today!
