    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;

As we approach the end of the year, I was thinking about you, and I know that Community and Fellowship are stepping stones that strengthen the foundation of a Church. At Office Depot, we understand the importance of creating a welcoming environment, which is why we thoughtfully bring together everything needed to present a gathering area that is inviting and hospitable.

Your relationship with Office Depot gives you access to premium coffee, the latest cash-management technology, and all of the items in-between to help you serve your congregation and visitors.

Please see the attachment that shows several ways that weâ€™ve been able to help churches in the past. If you are interested, please take a picture of your current coffee set-up and send it to me. I would love to give you a customized coffee solution for your organization.

As always, thank you for being a loyal Office Depot customer and for allowing me to help you build your community.


Best Regards,
